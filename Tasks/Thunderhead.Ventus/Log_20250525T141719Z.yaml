    What's New
    This release adds expanded support for Transient Simulations.
    This version of Ventus is designed for CONTAM version 3.4.0.5 and uses version 21.0.2+13 of the OpenJDK Java VM.
    Improved Transient Simulation Support
    Ventus 2024.2 continues the work started in the 2024.1 by furthering support for Transient CONTAM simulations.
    Expanded Support for Schedules
    The 2024.2 release expands the number of properties that can be defined using CONTAM schedules, which expands the use-cases possible when defining Transient simulations in Ventus.

    You can read more about the Scheduling options available in Ventus in the Ventus User Manual.
    2D Plot Dialog for Transient Results
    The 2024.2 release also includes a new visualization options for Transient simulation data in Ventus. Prior versions of Ventus required users to manually create plots for their simulation data via external tools. Ventus 2024.2 now creates these plots automatically.

    Updated Flow Path Visualizations
    Ventus 2024.2 includes some visual updates to Flow Paths. These updates make it easier to differentiate between Flow Path types: Ambient Flow Paths and Internal Flow Paths. Changes include a new 3D spherical representation for Internal Flow Paths, two new menu actions in the Analysis menu (Show Ambient Flow Paths and Show Internal Flow Paths), and an updated icon in the tree view for Ambient flow paths.
    Updated Flow Path visualizations for Ambient Flow Paths (red) and Internal Flow Paths (orange), updated tree icon for Ambient Flow Paths (left, flowpath07), and the 2 new menu actions available in Ventus 2024.2
    Changelog
    Improved Transient Simulation Support
    - Added support for time-varying multiplier schedules on Flow Paths.
    - Added support for time-varying multiplier schedules on Simple Air Handling Systems.
    - Added a 2D Plot dialog for graphing transient results.
    - Added a graph preview to the schedule editor.
    Flow Path Visualization Improvements
    - Added actions on the Analysis menu, tree icons, and updated 3D shapes to help identify and distinguish internal and external flow paths.
    - Ventus will issue a warning for flow paths that change from zone-zone to zone-ambient due to geometry modifications.
    Other Improvements
    - Added a splash screen for more responsive application startup (suppress with -J-Dnosplash)
    - Improved deletion, including consistent replacement handling, new access to reference information, and the ability to remember decisions.
    - The File menu option to export a PRJ file that contains CONTAMX but not CONTAMW data is now hidden by default (enable with -J-Dexport_prj_enable)
    - Replaced placeholder tooltips in the Simulation Parameters dialog.
    Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug in CAD import that could cause some models to be simplified more than intended.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when clicking the Copy button in the License dialog.
    - Fixed a bug allowing for negative values in multiplier schedules.
    - Fixed a bug where schedule times could be defined out of order.
    - Fixed a bug in Licensing and Activation where trailing spaces in the server name could cause hostname lookup errors.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the incorrect license source to be selected in Licensing and Activation Dialog.
    - Fixed a bug where renaming a flow path with an existed name fails without a notice.
    - Fixed a bug where a flow path's wall azimuth (wazm) is calculated incorrectly when the flow path's direction is changed to zone -> AMBIENT, resulting in incorrect output path data.
    - Fixed a bug when pasting objects where unexpected copies of referenced objects might be pasted as well.
    - Fixed a bug when pasting objects where a pasted object might reference an object already in the target model instead of that in the copy selection.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause a crash in the license activation dialog when clicking the local license folder.
    - Fixed a bug where renaming a Flow Element or Flow Element Group with the ${type} template option would replace the type with empty text.
    - Fixed a bug where default Flow Elements could be renamed.
