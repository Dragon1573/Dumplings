    This is a patch release. It contains the following changes:
    - Added a new welcome/what's new screen.
    - OpenVINO effects are now available on macOS. More about that can be found in this blogpost.
    - OpenVINO effects can now be found via the Get Effects button. (NB, this is a slow rollout - you may not see it there just yet at the time of release)
    - OpenVINO effects have been recategorized into their own category in the Effect menu. This also goes for the transcription and music generator feature, previously found in the Generate and Analyze menus, respectively.
