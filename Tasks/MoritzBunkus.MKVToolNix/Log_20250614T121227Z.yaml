    New features and enhancements
    - all: updated the various lists that go into IETF/BCP 47 language tags: ISO 639 languages; ISO 3166 countries; ISO 15924 regions; IANA subtag registries.
    - translations: added a Hungarian translation of the programs & man pages by Viktor György, John Fowler & Attila Zsigus (see AUTHORS).
    - mkvextract: tags extraction: added an option --no-track-tags (short: -T) for not extracting tags associated with tracks.
    - MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: the default regular expression for deriving the "forced display" track flag from file names for subtitles was extended to also match on the term signs. Implements #6094.
    - MKVToolNix GUI: preferences: the revert buttons for the various "default regex for…" will only be enabled when the current text differs from the default, in other words: when reverting would actually change the text. Part of the implementation of #6099.
    - MKVToolNix GUI: preferences: the GUI will now auto-upgrade the "default regex for…" to their respective current default values if they're still set to one of the previous default values. Part of the implementation of #6099.
