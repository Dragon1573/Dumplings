    New features and enhancements
    - mkvmerge: added a new file-specific option --regenerate-track-uids. When used for Matroska files, mkvmerge will generate new random track UIDs instead of keeping existing track UIDs. This is done automatically when a Matroska file was created by MakeMKV.
    - mkvmerge: MP4 reader: added support for FLAC in MP4. Implements #3692.
    - MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: the "Attachments" tab's title will now include the total number of attachments (both from source files & to newly attach). Implements #3693.
    - translations: added a Norwegian Bokm√•l translation of the programs by Roger Knutsen (see AUTHORS).

    Bug fixes
    - configure: when called with --disable-gui the build system still ran the check for the GUI libraries & failed if they weren't found. This check is now skipped when the option is given. Fixes #3680.
    - mkvmerge: several color-related track header properties were parsed into & stored as a wrong integer type internally. This could result in wrong values being copied when very large values were present in source files, or in error messages when very large values were used as command-line parameters.
    - MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: the keyboard shortcuts from the "modify selected tracks" sub-menu didn't work right after opening a file. They only started working after opening the "multiplexer" menu. Fixes #3681.

    Build system changes
    - Release v8.0.0 of the fmt library is now required. If not found, the bundled copy will be used.
    - A C20 compatible compiler is now required for several but certainly not all C20 features. g++ v10 & clang++ v10 should suffice.
