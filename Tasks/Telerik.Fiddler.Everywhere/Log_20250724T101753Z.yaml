    - Add compact tables view for session list, composer and inspectors to reduce row height and fit more data on the screen. Go to Settings > Appearance to switch between Default and Compact view.
    - Add support for parsing messages in server-sent events (SSE) sessions using HTTP/1.1

    Fixed
    - Error "Invalid session id/session source id" displayed when Fiddler works in the background
    - Email validation requires additional clicks when sharing resources with other users
    - The content-type header in composer requests gets duplicated in some cases
    - Scrolling inspectors view with small app window sometimes hides the session body contents
    - Update third-party dependencies to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities
