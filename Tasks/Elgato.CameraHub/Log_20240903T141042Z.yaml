    What‚Äôs new in Camera Hub 1.11?

    üó£Ô∏è Voice Sync - Intelligent script scrolling
    Powered by AI and machine learning, Voice Sync* ensures your script moves only when you speak. It adapts to your reading pace‚Äîwhether you speed up, slow down, or pause, the text follows your lead. Skip a line? Voice Sync adjusts seamlessly. Go off-topic? It waits for you to resume.
    Voice Sync supports English, German, Spanish, French, Dutch, Danish, Italian, and Portuguese, with more languages on the way.
    Additionally, a new optional reading line setting dims already-read text and highlights upcoming text, making it easier to follow along.
