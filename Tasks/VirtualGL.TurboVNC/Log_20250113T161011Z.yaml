    Significant changes relative to 3.1.2:
    1. Added a new Xvnc command-line option (-noserverkeymap) that can be used to disable the server-side key mapping feature introduced in 3.1 beta1[4].
    2. Added a new Xvnc command-line option (-syslog) that can be used to redirect all TurboVNC Server and X.org errors, warnings, and messages to the system log.
    3. Fixed a regression introduced by 2.2 beta1[7] that prevented the TurboVNC Server from being used as an inetd service.
    4. The "Tight Encoding Without Zlib" RFB extension, which was used unofficially by the Lossless Tight encoding method since TurboVNC v0.5, has been officially registered with IANA as an RFB pseudo-encoding. The TurboVNC Viewer now advertises support for the pseudo-encoding. (The next major release of the TurboVNC Server will forego using the extension unless the VNC viewer advertises support for it.)
    5. Fixed an issue in the TurboVNC Viewer's built-in SSH client whereby the ssh-rsa and rsa-sha2-512 signature schemes could not be used unless they were specified as the first argument for the HostKeyAlgorithms OpenSSH config file keyword or the server did not support rsa-sha2-256.
    6. Fixed an error ("ZlibInStream: inflate failed") that occurred in the TurboVNC Viewer when it attempted to receive a clipboard update from QEMU's VNC server.
    7. Fixed a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in the TurboVNC Server, introduced by 3.0 beta1[20], that triggered an infinite loop in the server's automatic WebSocket detection code if an ill-behaved client sent 3 or fewer bytes of data immediately after connecting. Certain versions of Apache Guacamole were known to trigger this issue sporadically.
    8. The TurboVNC Viewer now works around an issue that prevented keyboard grabbing from working when running the viewer in a GNOME/Wayland session.
