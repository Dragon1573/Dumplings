    Significant changes relative to 3.1.3:
    1. Fixed an issue whereby the TurboVNC Viewer threw a NullPointerException if a user clicked the "Connect" button in the New TurboVNC Connection dialog after entering an SSH username with a blank VNC host into the "VNC server" field.
    2. To better emulate the behavior of OpenSSH, the TurboVNC Viewer's built-in SSH client now allows the value of the SSHPort parameter, if specified on the command line or in a connection info file, to override any SSH ports specified in the OpenSSH config file.
    3. The TurboVNC Server now includes various security fixes (CVE-2023-5367, CVE-2023-6377, CVE-2023-6478, CVE-2023-6816, CVE-2024-0229, CVE-2024-0408, CVE-2024-9632, CVE-2024-21885, CVE-2024-21886, CVE-2024-31080, CVE-2024-31081, and CVE-2024-31083) from the xorg-server 21.1.x code base.
    4. Worked around an issue whereby recent versions of GNOME failed to launch in a TurboVNC session if the initial resolution of any of the screens in the session matched one of the default X RandR modes.
    5. Fixed an issue in the Mac TurboVNC Viewer whereby the viewer window did not display a vertical scrollbar, and the horizontal scrollbar was incorrectly sized, if multi-screen spanning was enabled, the scaled remote desktop was larger than the viewer window, and "Displays have separate Spaces" was enabled in the system settings.
    6. The Windows TurboVNC Viewer now sends Alt-F4 keystrokes to the VNC server if keyboard grabbing is enabled.
    7. Fixed a regression introduced by 3.1.2[2] that caused the Mac and Windows TurboVNC Viewers to incorrectly interpret Shift + vertical scroll wheel events as horizontal scroll wheel events.
    8. Fixed an issue whereby the TurboVNC Viewer's built-in SSH client threw a NullPointerException if a cipher algorithm supported by the SSH server but not by the SSH client was specified using the Ciphers OpenSSH config file keyword.
    9. Fixed an issue in the TurboVNC Viewer's built-in SSH client whereby the SSH connection timeout specified using the ConnectTimeout OpenSSH config file keyword was interpreted as milliseconds rather than seconds. This caused the SSH connection to fail if the timeout was too low.
    10. Fixed a regression introduced by 3.1 beta1[3] whereby the value of the TurboVNC Viewer's Subsampling parameter, if specified using the Samp alias, did not override per-host options that were previously saved by the TurboVNC Viewer Options dialog.
