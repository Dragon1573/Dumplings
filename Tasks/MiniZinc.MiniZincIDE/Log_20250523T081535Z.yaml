    Changes:
    - Add mzn_max_version_required to enable models to speficy the maximum version of MiniZinc required to run the model (issue 872).
    - Replace use of ptrdiff_t with appropriate unsigned integer type.
    - Clarify documentation example use of boolean extra flags in solver configuration files.
    - Warnings produced in solution checkers are now output as part of the checker message when running in --json-stream mode.
    Bug fixes:
    - Fix the rewriting of the multidimensional search annotations to ensure correct coercion of arguments (issue 897).
    - Output location of some errors where the problematic expression previously did not have a location (issue 899).
    - Fix domain computation to avoid variables being moved to the output model when they are constrained (issue 911).
    - Fix output processing to also respect the -o flag when flattening already detects unsatisfiability (issue 908).
    - Report an error when solving a FlatZinc file that does not contain a solve item (issue 907).
    - Pass command line options to the compiler phases earlier to avoid problems with e.g. the --disable-warnings flag (issue 893).
    - Fix incorrect generation of par versions of functions referencing top-level tuples/records containing var fields (issue 919).
    - Fix problem where using an iterator of variable tuple or record types could result in a segfault (issue 901).
    - Fix a problem where an operator such as <= on an optional type would sometimes lead to an internal compiler error (issue 898).
    - Print enum values in stack traces (issue 912).
    - Fix a bug where incompatible overloads could be used when dispatching to more specific versions of functions (issue 905).
    - Fix internal error when constraining the domain of var opt bool variables.
    - Fix record merge operator when evaluated via a field access (issue 892).
    - Update documentation to indicate that the float_ceil, float_floor, and float_round FlatZinc builtins need to be placed in redefinitions-2.7.1.mzn (issue 914).
    - Fix handling of basic standard flags when running .fzn files (issue 920).
    - Fix return type computation for generic functions called with tuple or record types (issue 902).
    - Fix type computation for arrays of tuples/records containing $T members.
    - Fix flattening of anonymous variables of enum type to be correctly bounded.
    - Emit type errors for unsupported usage of anonymous variables in tuples and records.
    - Fix incorrect flattening of in for tuples/records containing optional values (issue 900).
    Changes in the IDE:
    - Suppress warnings generated when running compiled solution checkers.
