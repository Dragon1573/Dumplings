    This release was expedited to cover critical vulnerability CVE-2025-6554 (#1486).
    Some other changes were made:
    (#1480) - "Web Scrobbler" extension should now work on Windows XP, as well as other extensions that create notifications
    (#1473) - Favicons should no longer slide out of tab bounds when dozens of tabs are open in a given window
    (#1483) - Support for custom tab and new tab button shapes that are derived from an scs file are disabled by default after some users experienced performance declines after their introduction. This functionality is now gated behind the --enable-advanced-customization switch.
