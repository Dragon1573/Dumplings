    This exceptional release of Supermium includes various enhancements over Supermium 132 R3, including:
    (#1372) - some tweaks to the look-and-feel of v109 Tabs. Tab-specific compact UI options are separated from #compact-ui, now in #compact-tab-ui.
    (#1370) - a new feature named #open-bookmark-option allows users to open bookmarks in new tabs, either in the foreground or background. This replaces the equivalent Chrome++ functionality that is currently unstable with Supermium.
    (#1382) - drag-and-drop fully restored on NT 5.x.
    (#1368) - CR23: tab separator duplication disabled by default, other metrics modified including tab gaps
    (#1367) - Widevine patch updated for version 4.10.2891.0
