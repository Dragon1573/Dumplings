    - Enabled agents to have their local plugin databases recompiled from the management console.

    - Agents no longer have to wait for plugin compilation to complete before connecting to their managers.
    - Agents now recompile plugins and libraries only if they or their dependencies have changed.
    Supported Platforms

    Upgrade Notes
    - You can upgrade to the latest version of Tenable Agent from any previously supported version.
    - If your upgrade path skips versions of the Tenable Agent, Tenable recommends reviewing the release notes for all skipped versions to learn about new features and bug fixes.
    - If you are connecting to Tenable Vulnerability Management through Tenable Nessus scanners, Tenable Agents, Tenable Web App Scanning scanners, or Tenable Network Monitors (NNM) located in mainland China, you must connect through sensor.cloud.tenablecloud.cn instead of sensor.cloud.tenable.com.
    - New Tenable Vulnerability Management Domain - As a part of continuous security and scalability improvements to Tenable infrastructure, we have added a new sensor.cloud.tenable.com domain that Tenable Vulnerability Management-linked Tenable Agents communicate with.
      - Tenable Vulnerability Management-linked Tenable Agents communicate with Tenable Vulnerability Management using sensor.cloud.tenable.com. If agents versions 8.1.0 through 10.3.1 are not able to connect to the new domain, they fall back to using cloud.tenable.com. Tenable Agent 10.3.2 and later do not fall back using the cloud.tenable.com domain.
      - Recommended Action: If you use domain allow lists for firewalls, Tenable recommends adding *.cloud.tenable.com (with the wildcard character) to the allow list. This ensures communication with sensor.cloud.tenable.com and all future subdomains, reducing operational overhead. Contact your network administrator for assistance with making necessary changes to your allow list.
