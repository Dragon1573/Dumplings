    Windows Explorer Context Menu Extension
    - Re-added ability to configure menu items to appear directly on the top level menu or in a "Beyond Compare" submenu when shown on the Windows 10, in Windows 11's "Show More Options" menu, and in third-party applications.
    - Fixed extension not appearing in "Run As Administrator" processes on Windows 11 (e.g., Total Commander).
    - Fixed extension not showing in Windows 11 for ARM64 "Show More Options" menu. Supporting the top-level menu is still a goal, but we're waiting on Delphi's ARM64 compiler.
    - Fixed installing shell extension on Windows 11 21H1 and 21H2. Upgrades from 5.0.2 or earlier will need to turn on the extension in the Options dialog or manually uninstall/reinstall to enable it.
    - Fixed "Compare to ..." caption incorrectly showing the entire path for files/folders on portable media devices (MTP).
    - Fixed comparing files on portable devices (MTP) when Explorer's "Show > File name extensions" option is turned off.
    - Fixed menu items not appearing in Libraries virtual folders in cases where BC4 did.
    - Fixed menu items incorrectly appearing on unsupported virtual folders (e.g., "Libraries") and then trying to open BC with an invalid path.
    - Fixed duplicate menu items when showing context menu for network servers/shares in Explorer's navigation treeview.
    - Fixed using "Select Left" on a drive root showing the second menu as 'Compare to ""'.
    - Fixed using "Select Left" on a file and then selecting a drive root that contains a matching filename showing the second menu as 'Compare to \file.ext' instead of 'Compare to C:\file.ext'.
    - Fixed ability for a non-admin user to toggle off and on the Win11 context menu after installing for all users.
    - Fixed icons appearing with a solid black background when running in an ARM64 process or when selecting files on portable media devices.
    - Recreated Select Left/Center arrow icons to be more in line with the v4 appearance.
