    This is a correction release which fixes a problem in the build of the Msys2 part of release 5948.
    A typical symptom of the problem in 5948 is that Msys2 packages cannot be installed or upgraded using pacman.
    Users who have already upgraded to 5948 and wish to avoid another upgrade may choose to fix the problem by running update-ca-trust in the Rtools (Msys2) shell, this will allow installation/upgrading of packages.
    A more complete fixup is to run:
    for F in /var/lib/pacman/local/*/install ; do
      bash -c  "cd / ; . $F ; [[ \$(type -t post_install)  == function ]] && post_install"
    done
    At the time of this correction release, the corresponding experimental build for aarch64 has been updated. It has several improvements allowing more of CRAN packages to be built for aarch64 than with 5948.
Version: 4.3.5958
