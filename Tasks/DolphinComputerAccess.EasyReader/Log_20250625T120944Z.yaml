    The latest update to EasyReader enhances accessibility, so you can read comfortably,
    in the ways that work best for you. With improved usability, it's easier than ever to focus on
    what matters most: the joy of reading.

    More Accessible UI
    New icons and colours fully comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure better
     usability for all. Bigger buttons mean easier navigation and My Account is now more prominently
     displayed, so managing your settings is effortless. Plus, a new icon shows precisely how much of your
    book you've read - perfect for tracking your reading progress.

    Full Screen Mode
    Immerse yourself in the story with a single tap. This new mode clears distractions for a clear, focused
     reading experience.

    'Ask A Question' in EasyReader Help
    AI-powered support is just a click away, helping you get the most out of EasyReader. Plus, if
    you spot one, you can now 'Report a Bug' in EasyReader Help, so we can continue to provide you with
    the best reading experience.

    Screen Reader View
    Designed for braille readers and screen readers, this new linear reading mode ensures seamless
    navigation for vision impaired readers.

    Image Descriptions (Premium Feature)
    Hear a description of any image in your book - generated by AI - to enhance your reading enjoyment.
