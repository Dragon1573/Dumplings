    + Simplified control panel options in Assassin's Creed Shadows.
     + Reduced NVAPI HW sensor monitoring and VRR status check overhead on recent
         NVIDIA drivers.
     + Options to override RGB colors on DualSense controllers now apply (in USB) in
                games using SONY's native API.
     + Fixed occasional double keyboard input processing (SK hotkeys) when using
         ReShade 6.4.0+.
     + Improved Unity Engine texture cache compatibility in versions > 2021.
     + Terminate hung nvngx_update.exe processes at game exit, rather than when
         the global injection service starts/stops.
     + Added delay to ExitProcess (...) hook to ensure that SK saves its DLL cfg
         in Assassin's Creed Shadows before the game crashes during its exit code.
