  Value: |-
    + Detect and ignore RTSS Reflex latency markers because they actually
        lead to increased latency when they interfere with SK's framerate limiter.
     + Improve handling of WM_DEVICECHANGE for DBT_DEVNODES_CHANGED to throttle the
        performance-related problems from plugging/unplugging controllers, without
          causing some games to stop supporting controller hotplug altogether.
     + Disable DXGI Flip Model by default in Metro 2033 to avoid visual glitches.
     + Fixed scRGB HDR-related issues in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.
