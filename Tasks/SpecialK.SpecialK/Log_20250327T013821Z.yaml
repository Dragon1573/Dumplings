  Value: |-
    + Fixed Assassin's Creed Shadows capped framerate occasionally being restored
         when it was not supposed to be, following the new memory scanning change.
     + Adjusted DLL shutdown procedure to flush INI files before anything else, since
         some games terminate in the middle of unloading SK's DLL.
     + Simplified Assassin's Creed Shadows initialization code.
     + Terminate hung nvngx_update.exe instances when launching games, because it
         can prevent proper launch/exit if the game infinitely waits for a broken
           DLSS over-the-air-update.
     + Added INI option to disable keyboard IME services in a game, in order to
         fix Assassin's Creed deadlocking when combinations of Alt+Shift are used.
