    + Removed reshade::addon_event::display_change from SK's codebase, because
         it was not merged into ReShade 6.4.0 and some addons behave funny with it.
     + Added DLSS Multi-Frame Generation Rate to text OSD and control panel.
     + Added pacing option to Alt-Tab for ADHD users with poor impulse control.
     + Added command console variable to control Alt-Tab pacing:

         Input.Keyboard.AltTabPace   (Milliseconds between Alt-Tab if >= 0)

     + Made Windows Key / Alt+Tab block/unblock into a configurable feature in the
         new Input Management | Keyboard section of the control panel.
     + Added command console variables to control keyboard special key blocking:

         Input.Keyboard.EnableAltTab
         Input.Keyboard.EnableWinKey

          -1 = Don't Care, 0 = Block, 1 = Allow
