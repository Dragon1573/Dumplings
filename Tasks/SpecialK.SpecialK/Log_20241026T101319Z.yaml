    Below are the highlights between v 24.10.25.2 - v 24.10.26.2:

     + Fixed SKIF not being able to disable GFE notifications due to disabled code
     + Increase delay between first drawing an achievement unlock popup and taking
         screenshot, so that statistics such as unlock time reliably appear.
     + Optimize SK_D3D11_SetShader_Impl (...)/SK_D3D11_EnsureMatchingDevices (...)
         to use D3D11 Private Data lookups.
     + Add Alt+F4 handler override to workaround Ys X's buggy Alt+F4 code that
         tends to close the game window, but leave the game running.
Version: 24.10.26.2
