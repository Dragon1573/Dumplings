    + Added detection and automatic removal of 500 Hz polling rate limit in games that
         statically link to libScePad (i.e. DOOM: The Dark Ages).
     + Fixed various issues with SK's Drag-n-Drop handler initialization failing
     + Added support for loading D3D11 texture mods by dragging a file from one
         location on disk (or straight from 7-zip) to the game winodw, rather than
           the only previously supported method (download-by-dragging-URL).
     + Added INI option to disable SK's "Drop Handler," in case a game or
         more likey, an emulator, actually relies on this functionality.

        [Window.System]
        AllowDragNDrop={true|false}  Default: true; prevents game's normal handling

     + Workaround new issues in DOOM: The Dark Ages window management and Reflex
         related to creating / resizing windows.
