    Below are the highlights between v 24.9.17.3 - v 24.9.18.4:

     + Fixed potential "Steam is Offline" errors in Final Fantasy XVI for some users
     + Fixed edge-case where DLSS3 Frame Generation is active on a VRR display, but SK was not disabling tearing while the game has VSYNC turned off.

     + Baldur's Gate 3 has native DualSense support now, but lacks DualSense Edge support, so SK is configured to identify DualSense Edge controllers as DualSense to make them work natively in Baldur's Gate 3.

     + Adjusted SEH Exception logging code for compatibility with GOG Galaxy API

     + Use Flip Sequential by default if a game is already Flip Model and uses Sequential, or if upgrading a Blt Sequential game to  Flip Model, or if ReShade is loaded.

        >> This helps screenshot compatibility in games when using ReShade.

     + Enable "Fake Fullscreen" by default in FFXVI to make HDR less of a nuisance
     + Patched out graphics debugger check from Final Fantasy XVI Retail
Version: 24.9.18.4
