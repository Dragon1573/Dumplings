    Below are the highlights between v 24.12.12 - v 24.12.19.3:

     + Overhauled Windows.Gaming.Input implementation to support hot-plugging
          PlayStation controllers and enabling "Xbox Mode" without requiring a
            complete game restart.
     + Add logarithmic scaling to deadzone compensation on PlayStation controllers
          and extend the option to native Xbox controllers also.
     + Fixed off-by-one issue when quantizing the x-axis in some PlayStation device
          configurations.
      + Allow DualSense users (non-Edge version) to access the Impulse Trigger
          strength slider.
      + Correctly show PlayStation icon in GameInput games only when PlayStation
          input/output is active, for native GameInput remove the icon.
      + Reduce latency on HID output reports (i.e. rumble, lighting changes, etc.)
          for DualShock 4 and DualSense{Edge} controllers.
      + Clear the state of the PlayStation button when all PlayStation controllers
          disconnect, so that SK doesn't block all other buttons because it thinks
            the user is trying to input a PlayStation + <...> button combo.
      + Correctly implement AVIF screenshot encoder quality; quantizer was set to
          lossless at all quality levels before!
