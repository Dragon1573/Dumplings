    Below are the highlights between v 24.9.16 - v 24.9.17.2:

     + Hotfix for VBlank counting thread running while a game has destroyed and is re-creating a SwapChain.
     + Added RAM warning if used system RAM reaches >= 98% while a game is running
     + Added command console variable to control DXGI Budget Scale (see 24.9.10)

               DXGI.VRAMBudgetScale     (Range: 0.1 - 5.0)

            [ Press Ctrl+Shift+Tab to Open/Close the Command Console ]

          * Some games will respond in real-time to changes to this.
          * Changes made from the command console are saved to SK's per-game INI.

         This allows tweaking over- or under-reporting of available VRAM to get a game to load in higher detail
           assets or evict memory to reduce stutter.

     + Disable tearing if using a VRR screen w/ DLSS3 Frame Gen, so FG can use G-Sync instead of randomly tear :)
     + Improved precision of real-time VRR refresh rate calculation
     + Restored the gray bars of 'animation error' (as PresentMon calls it) to users with drivers that support
         HW GPU Scheduling + HW Flip Queue

     + Added CPU affinity INI option

         [Scheduler.System]
         ProcessorAffinityMask=[1,0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF] Default=0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

        This is a bitmask, so map out the processor numbers you want in binary and then convert to decimal.

          (i.e. ProcessorAffinityMask=1365  ->  10101010101  (6 physical cores))
Version: 24.9.17.2
