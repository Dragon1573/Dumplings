  Value: |-
    + Added JPEGNotQuality setting (defaults to 96) for JPEG screenshots imported
        to Steam, refer to Global\osd.ini -- does not apply to thumbnails.
        * Compression 'Quality' of JPEG: 0=Oh No!, 100=Still crap...
     + Block WM_DEVICECHANGE messages for DBT_DEVNODES_CHANGED because it is
         unnecessary and kills performance in many Steam Input games.
     + Removed Denuvo for free-tier users; Patreon subscribers still get the
         awesome performance and stability benefits of Denuvo.
