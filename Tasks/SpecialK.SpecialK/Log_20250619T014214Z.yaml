  Value: |-
    + Uncap internal controller polling rate limit (500 Hz) in libScePad games
         (that use libScePad.dll, as opposed to static linking) in order to correctly
           support DualSense Edge's full capabilities (1 kHz native) on PC.
     + When a game turns Reflex Low Latency + Boost mode on and enables Boost using
         Latency Markers, SK will now use that as the default override setting.
     + Added HEIC decode support to SKIV.
     + Added proper handling of Ray Reconstruction in Vulkan games.
     + Prevent altering window layering (always-on-top) in DOOM: The Dark Ages to
         workaround window management bugs merged from Indiana Jones' idTech code.
