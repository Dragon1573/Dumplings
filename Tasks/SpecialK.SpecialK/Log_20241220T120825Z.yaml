    Below are the highlights between v 24.12.19.3 - v 24.12.20.1:

      + Fixed EOS crash in games using extremely old versions of EOS SDK lacking
         support for EOS_UI_AddNotifyDisplaySettingsUpdated (i.e. Path of Exile 2).
     + Add mutex to SK_IWrapD3D11DeviceContext::Release (...) to handle recursion
         during deferred destruction of D3D11 Immediate Device Context singleton.
     + Eliminate unnecessary load of Windows.Gaming.Input.dll in games that do not
         actually use the API.
     + Fixed various minor issues discovered using static analysis with PVS-Studio.
Version: 24.12.20.1
