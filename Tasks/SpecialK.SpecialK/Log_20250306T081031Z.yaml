    + Auto-load REFramework.dll in Monster Hunter Wilds so that it does not have
         to be loaded as dinput8.dll and will work more stable.
     + Prevent REFramework from breaking various DirectInput code that causes input
         problems in Monster Hunter Wilds, provided you load it as REFramework.dll
           instead of dinput8.dll.
     + Disable Reflex Sleep permanently in Monster Hunter Wilds, after profiling
         their Reflex implementation is so bad that it's only increasing latency.

       * Make sure you are using nightly build from 25/3/4 or newer of REFramework;
           the only purpose for Reflex Sleep was to improve framegen pacing when
             the game's anti-tamper runs every frame and REFramework removes the
               frame pacing obstacle at its source.
