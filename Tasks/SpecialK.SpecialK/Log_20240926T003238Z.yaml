    Below are the highlights between v 24.9.20.1 - v 24.9.26:

     + Fixed forced 10-bpc being applied to AMD's Vulkan interop; it is a compat.
         hack for NVIDIA's interop-only and does not work on AMD's driver.
     + Do not list XInput slot# for UI controller in the Input Management section
         of the control panel when only a PlayStation controller is attached.
     + Revert back to asynchronous initialization by default for Streamline games,
         unless the new AllowFakeStreamline setting is set to false.
     + Force AllowFakeStreamline OFF in Ratchet & Clank
     + Added crash_handler.exe to internal injection blacklist
     + Added up to 100 ms spin if D3D11 hooks initialize before DXGI capabilities
         have been determined (i.e. flip model); if initialization times out, we
           will assume that Flip Model and Tearing are both supported.

     + Added option to disable strict Streamline compatibility, because it
         is not compatible with various DLSS3->FSR3 mods that do not implement
           all of Streamline.

              [Compatibility.General]
             AllowFakeStreamline={true|false}   Default=true

         This may hurt stability in games that use real Streamline, but it is
           unlikely the myriad of mods pretending to be Streamline will be made
             more compatible any time soon.

     + Added LOD Bias and Anisotropic Filtering options to the D3D12 control panel

     + Added INI option to force a Mipmap LOD bias in D3D12 games

        [Render.D3D12]
        ForceLODBias=[-32.0,32.0]  Default=0.0 (Unchanged)

       >> An LOD Bias of 0.0 is technically valid, but using this INI, it cannot
            be set... consider using -0.000001 if you want to force all LOD Bias
              in a game to 0.0 for some reason.

        - Negative biases increase sharpening and shimmering in texture filtering,
            the most likely use-case for a user to override them would be applying
              a small negative LOD bias to sharpen textures when using DLSS/FSR.

     + Add workaround for implicit AMD OpenGL/DXGI Interop so that OpenGL-IK
         will always work without interference from AMD's D3D12 SwapChain.
Version: 24.9.26
