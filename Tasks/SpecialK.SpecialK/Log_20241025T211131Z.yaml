    Below are the highlights between v 24.10.24 - v 24.10.25.2:

      + Change compiler settings to generate code more compatible with the Steam
         overlay on some systems.
     + Enable Multitasking-on-Top mode by default
     + Make gamepad input activity hide the cursor as default policy
         when enabling cursor auto-hide
     + Add checks to prevent confusing SKIF and SKIV when SK needs to send
         signals to SKIF during injection.
     + Prevent turning off "Background Render" mode while Fake Fullscreen is
         enabled.
     + Improve SDL detection for games (i.e. Ys X) that use SDL, but have
         overridden the default window class name.
     + Add various default behavior overrides for SDL games to avoid double
         input polling and buggy window management without recompiling SDL.

       * An INI parameter has been added to control this,

        [Compatibility.General]
        SDLSanityLevel={0,1,2}  Default=1

          0=Do Nothing
          1=Set SK Optimized Values if no SDL environment variables are set
          2=Force SK Optimized Values
Version: 24.10.25.2
