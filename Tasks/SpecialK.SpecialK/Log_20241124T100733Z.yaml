    Below are the highlights between v 24.11.16.3 - v 24.11.24.2:

     + Fixed D3D11 screenshots occasionally causing display mode changes to fail if
         resolution changes after taking a screenshot.
     + Cleaned-up Mouse Cursor section of Input Control Panel and removed the old,
            "Low-Level Mouse Settings" section.
     + Update ReShade Add-on API headers to include new events in the next release.
     +Enable Fake Fullscreen mode by default in STALKER 2, because it uses that
         crap (in D3D12) for HDR...
     + Disable SteamAPI file hash checks on Fallout 4.
     + Fixed problems with SK not re-initializing D3D11 when the active SwapChain
         is destroyed and re-created.
Version: 24.11.24.2
