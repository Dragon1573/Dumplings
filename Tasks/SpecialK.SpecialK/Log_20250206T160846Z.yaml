    + Xbox Guide + Start or PlayStation + Start now triggers HUDless screenshots,
         provided d3d11_shaders.ini defines any HUD shaders.
     + Fixed some EOS games not triggering EOS SDK hooks for overlay/achievement
         features when using Global Injection.
     + Fixed HUDless screenshots not working in some D3D11 games...
         (mostly ones that use fewer than 3 buffers in their SwapChain).
     + Fixed monochrome JPEG achievement icons showing up as misaligned Red-only
         textures in D3D12 achievement popups. (They are converted to RGBA now...).
     + Fixed Chrono Cross resolution uncap not working after December's D3D11 state
         tracking optimization.
     + Disable Hardware Cursor in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.
