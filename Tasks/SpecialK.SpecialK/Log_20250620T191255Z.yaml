    + Remove libScePad handle caching introduced in 25.6.18 (fixes haptics).
     + Remove warning on game calling undocumented SetWindowsHookExAW function
         directly, unless log level is set to >= 1.
     + Reduce overhead of background input and screensaver detection.
     + Fixed potential crash at DLL unload in dbghelper.dll!SymCleanup (...).
     + Add 16 frame ReShade re-initialization delay after SwapChain destruction,
         in order to prevent bad stuff in DOOM: The Dark Ages.
     + Add pointer validation to SK_ReShadeAddOn_GetRuntimeForSwapChain (...).
     + Throttle RegisterDragDrop (...) failure retries to once every 200 ms.
     + Fixed handling of Epic/Steam overlay activation when clicking EOS/SteamAPI
         frame counter (in games that have overlay callbacks installed).
     + Added console variable to toggle virtual Steam/Epic overlay (to pause game).

          Platform.OverlayPause {true|false|toggle}

        This provides a handy pause function in games like Stellar Blade that
          normally do not support pause during cutscenes, etc.

           [Macro.PlatformPause]
           Alt+P=Platform.OverlayPause toggle

        * Add that (customize the keys to your liking) to Global\macros.ini or to
            a game's SpecialK.ini to trigger a game's pause function on-demand.

       NOTE:  Not all games on Steam or Epic support Overlay Activation Pause.

              Check whether the SteamAPI or EOS Frame counter at the bottom
                of the control panel is clickable (game is overlay-aware).

        -> Feature requires you to NOT disable SteamAPI integration :)
