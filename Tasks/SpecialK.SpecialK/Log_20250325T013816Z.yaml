    + Added new "Fully Unlocked" mode to Assassin's Creed Shadows, that patches
         a few extra pieces of code in a way that the setting cannot be turned
           off without restarting the game.

        * In exchange for having to restart the game to switch modes, performance
            is better than the basic unlock setting.

     + Turned the "FMV Playing" indicator into an option (disabled by default now).
