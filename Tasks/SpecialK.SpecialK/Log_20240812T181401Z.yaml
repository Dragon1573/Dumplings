    Below are the highlights between v 24.7.30 - v 24.8.11.1:

     + Add additional HDR metadata logging in games that use HDR metadata
     + Auto-fix games that use invalid HDR metadata values when SK is not
         configured to disable HDR metadata outright (HDRMetadataType=-2)
     + Increase maximum HDR pipeline remaster RenderTarget size (after upgrade)
         from 128 MiB to 256 MiB. Resources that require more VRAM will continue
           to be ignored, which may affect users supersampling to > 8K.
     + Add support for HDR10 UAV upgrades in Trine 4.
         >> Unordered Access View format mismatches were not being handled for
              the case where the original format had the same number of bits as
                the new format (i.e. R10G10B10A2 = 32-bpp, R8G8B8A8 = 32-bpp)
     + Apply IDXGISwapChain3::SetColorSpace1 (...) whenever a D3D11/D3D12 SwapChain
         overlay instance is (re)created, for compatibility with RenoDX / ReShade.
     + Improved handling of wide gamut scRGB colors when doing HDR->SDR tonemapping

     + Ignore texture hashing on D3D11 array textures because injection is not
         supported and it reads from unallocated memory in Trine 4.

     + Fixed display of achievement titles and descriptions containing % characters
         in ImGui popups since ImGui expects a printf-formatted string...
