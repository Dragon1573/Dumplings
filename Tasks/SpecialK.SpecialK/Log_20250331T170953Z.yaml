    + Restructure hook initialization procedure during startup to get render APIs
          initialized earlier and separate input API initialization that should not
            be done from DllMain.
     + Added nvngx_update.exe hung process termination back to injection service.
     + Remove multiple calls to slDLSSGSetOptions (...) during one frame in
          Assassin's Creed Shadows.
     + Fixed AC Shadows flagging sl::PreferenceFlags::eAllowOTA without flagging
          sl::PreferenceFlags::eLoadDownloadedPlugins, which causes DLLs to update,
            but the updated DLLs never to load (i.e. why DLSS/Reflex doesn't work).

         * This fix may require local injection if render hook initialization is
             too slow; it cannot be fixed if delayed injection is used.
