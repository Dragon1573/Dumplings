    Bluefish 2.2.17 is a maintenance release that has only code cleanup fixes to comply better with modern compiler standards. It furthermore has fixes for a 64bit Windows build of Bluefish with Msys2. So there finally is an up to date Bluefish installer for windows again!
    The windows build has a few remaining issues that need to be solved. The biggest issue is that starting external commands from within Bluefish does not yet work (such as a preview in browser, an external filter or just your favourite CI/CD pipeline). The other big issues is the character map plugin that is not yet included in the installer.

ReleaseTime: 2025-03-31
