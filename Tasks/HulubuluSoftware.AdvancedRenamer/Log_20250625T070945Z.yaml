    Move, Delete, or Rename existing target files

    When setting up a renaming batch you might end up with the error "File already exists". This can be most common when moving or copying files to a new location. It has been requested that the program should have an option to overwrite existing files, but that makes it difficult to undo a batch properly. Instead you will now have these three options, before starting the batch:
    - Move existing files to a new location
    - Move existing files to recycle bin
    - Rename existing files
    The buttons will show automatically in panel in the bottom of the main window, when at least one item has the "File already exists" error.
    When renaming or moving files with this feature, the program will use Advanced Renamer technology to produce the new names and file paths, which means you can use the same tags as in a standard renaming batch and you can even revert the action.
    Note, this only works for files, not folders.

    Export list, including all metadata

    A new window for exporting the file list has been added, with many more options. As always you can export to text and CSV file, but now you can also export to JSON format. There are plenty of options for how the program should format the output and which encoding to use. You can choose to export the columns of the item list as it is or export all metadata found in the files.
    A later version will extend the support for importing files and enriching the list of files with more data from external sources.
