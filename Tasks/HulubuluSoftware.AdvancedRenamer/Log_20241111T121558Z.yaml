    MediaType tag

    Use the tag <MediaType> do get the media type group name. Advanced Renamer groups files into 5 categories. Use this tag to extract this value. The media type is determined by the file extension and is not based on the actual content. Possible valures are: image, audio, video, document, and other

    "Now" option added to Timestamp method

    Use the "Now" option in the Timestamp method to quickly set the timestamp to the current date and time. This is faster than setting the same value with the absolute date and time option.

    Read metadata from font files

    For the first time, Advanced Renamer gets support for reading metadata from font files. The supported file types are .ttf and .otf.

    Recognize any date and time metadata value

    If the name of a meta data value contain the words tdate or time, it can be parsed and used as a regular timestamp value, by adding a second parameter for the format, like yyyy-mm-dd_hh_nn_ss. You can even adjust the timestamp value with the adjustment parameter added in version 4.04.
