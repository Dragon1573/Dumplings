    Titlecase

    As an addition to uppercasing the first letter in every word, titlecase can be used to give a similar result, but with smaller connecting words like "and", "or", "the", "a", and "of" in lowercase. This is a common way to write movie, music, and book titles in English. In the settings window, you can choose which words to keep in lowercase when using titlecase. See Wikipedia article for more info.

    Stripes in list

    For better readability, the list can now be displayed with stripes. This is especially useful when working with long lists of files. The stripes can be enabled in the settings window.

    Method condition improvements

    The method conditions have been improved with new fields for matching path and name as a single string and match field to make the method condition only match if the field value is short or longer than a given value.
