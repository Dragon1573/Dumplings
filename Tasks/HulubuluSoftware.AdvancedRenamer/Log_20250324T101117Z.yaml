    Automatic method titles

    When multiple methods of the same type are used in a batch, the title of the method will show basic information about the method configuration. This makes it easier to see what each method does without having to open the method panel. The default setting is to only show the configuration when there are multiple of the same type, but this can be changed in the Settings window on the Program tab.

    Not all methods will support this (Script, List, List Replace, and Trim). Those that are list based does not have an obvious basic info to show.

    New modes for Remove method

    The Remove method has been extended with new remove types to make it easier to perform certain types of removals from filenames.

    The new types are:
    Position - Like the existing functionality of the Remove method.
    Pattern - Works like the Remove pattern method.
    Accents and special marks - For easy removal of accents and special marks, also known as diacritics.
    Word characters
    Non-word characters
    Upper case - Remove all characters that are upper case.
    Lower case - Remove all characters that are lower case.
    Character list - A list of characters to remove.
    Numbers - Remove all numeric values.

    This change effectively makes the Remove pattern method redundant. Later versions of Advanced Renamer might not be able to create new Remove pattern methods, but full backwards compatibility will be maintained.

    Remove character accents

    As mentioned in the paragraph above, the new remove type Accents and special marks can be used to remove accents and special marks from filenames. This is useful when you want to remove accents from characters like é, è, ê, and ë. Only accent and special mark is removed, leaving the clean character behind.

    Layout changes for Timestamp method

    The user interface Timestamp method was getting too tall and was diverging from the layout of other methods. The "Set to" controls have been changed from radio buttons to a dropdown.

    Some settings have moved
    The Program tab in the Settings window was getting too crowded, so some settings have been moved to other tabs, for the most part the Renaming tab.
