  Value: W-15749529 Data loss after the incremental refresh of a scheduled flow. When a flow scheduled by a linked task is run only the rows that are new since the previous run are output to the data source. The rows that existed before this run were lost. Since incremental refresh is configured for the flow, the new rows should be appended to existing rows rather than overwriting them.
