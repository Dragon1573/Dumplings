    Added
    Before, you needed to export environment variable GITHUB_TOKEN to make authenticated requests to download assets from private repositories and avoid rate limit issues.
    Now, you can also export one of the following environment variables:
    1. DRA_GITHUB_TOKEN
    2. GITHUB_TOKEN (same as before)
    3. GH_TOKEN
    If none of the above environment variables are set, the GitHub cli token (if available) will be used as default value.
    If you would like to disable GitHub authentication, you can export the environment variable DRA_DISABLE_GITHUB_AUTHENTICATION=true
