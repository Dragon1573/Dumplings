    New
    Branch Dependencies: We have introduced the ability to create branch dependencies in Tower, laying the groundwork for many upcoming features and enhancements. This function allows Tower to keep track of the original branch from which a new branch is created—a capability not natively supported by Git. Newly created branches in Tower automatically inherit their parent branch, and users can manually set or change the parent branch using the context menu. Stacked Branches: As the first feature to leverage our new Branch Dependencies, Tower enables you to create "stacks" of branches—branches that depend on other branches—and effortlessly restack them with a single action. This greatly simplifies workflows that rely on stacked branches, eliminating the cumbersome and error-prone process of manually restacking multiple branches. You can activate this feature through the "Workflows" toolbar button. Sync Action: This feature synchronizes your HEAD branch with a remote branch by first pulling commits and, if the pull is successful, then pushing the commits. UI: The app now uses a "Mica material" for a semi-transparent, softly blurred background. UI: The in-app accent color is now synchronized with the Windows accent color. UI: The Windows taskbar now displays the repository name for easier identification of open windows.
    Improved
    Compare branches: Improved the readability of the branch selector in the Compare branches feature to accommodate longer branch names. Compare branches: When a parent branch is defined, it will now be set as the default branch for comparison. Commit list view: Adjusted the order of ref badges to align with Tower on macOS. Keyboard shortcuts - Quick Open: Added the shortcut Shift+Enter to open a repository in a new window. Keyboard shortcuts: Introduced Ctrl+Shift+Backspace to discard all local changes. Keyboard shortcuts: Assigned Shift+Ctrl+A to stage all local changes. Keyboard shortcuts: Improved reliability of keyboard navigation using Ctrl+0..5. Error Logging: Enhanced for more detailed and effective diagnostics. UI: The top bar has been rearranged for better usability. Updated the provided Portable Git to version 2.47.2.
    Fixed
    Detecting unsafe directories accessed via mapped network drives and adding them to “safe.directories” in gitconfig now works as expected. Commit View: The issue where commit history would disappear from the list while scrolling in certain scenarios has been fixed. When adding a repository via "File -> Open" the repository will now be added to bookmarks and opened. Services: Previously, GitLab repositories were incorrectly displayed in some groups, but this issue has now been resolved. Sidebar: The application no longer crashes when opening the submodule context menu. Commit list view: Resolved an issue where Ref badges were missing in certain scenarios. Installer: The extraction of Portable Git was failing under certain locale settings, but this issue has now been resolved. Services: Creating new repositories on GitLab is now functioning as expected. Repository Settings: An issue that prevented the .gitattributes file from being opened in an external editor when configuring Git LFS has been corrected. UI: A bug that caused window borders to clip when maximizing Tower has been addressed. Cloning LFS repositories through SSH, which occasionally failed, has been fixed. A crash that occurred when opening a repository that does not contain any branches has been fixed. A potential crash that occurred when displaying a toast notification has also been fixed.
