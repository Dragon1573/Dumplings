    New
    - Firefox will now offer to temporarily remember when users grant permissions to sites (e.g. geolocation). Temporary permissions will be removed either after one hour or when the tab is closed.

    - A tab preview is now displayed when hovering the mouse over background tabs, making it easier to locate the desired tab without needing to switch tabs.

    - When suggesting a default translation language, Firefox will now take into consideration languages you have previously used for translations.
    - Weâ€™ve re-introduced the ability to navigate to the search engine home page when the search bar is empty by using shift-enter/shift-click.
    Fixed
    - Various security fixes.
    Changed
    - The following language is now supported by Firefox translation:
      - Swedish
    - The Tab overview (List all tabs) menu has received a new, refreshed icon.
    Enterprise
    - You can find information about policy updates and enterprise specific bug fixes in the Firefox for Enterprise 131 Release Notes.
    Developer
    - As part of the ongoing updates to SVG 2, SVGGraphicsElement.nearestViewportElement and SVGGraphicsElement.farthestViewportElement have been officially removed. Please note that these properties have had deprecation warnings since February.
    - Firefox now supports text fragments, which allows users to link directly to a specific portion of text in a web document via a special URL fragment. (Learn more)
    Web Platform
