    New
    - Profile management helps protect your privacy and stay focused by separating your online life into distinct profiles — for work, school, vacation planning, or whatever you choose. You can now name your profiles and customize them with avatars and color themes for easy recognition, then quickly switch between them — all while keeping bookmarks, tabs, and browsing history completely separate.

      This feature is part of a progressive roll out.
      What is a progressive roll out?
      Certain new Firefox features are released gradually. This means some users will see the feature before everyone does. This approach helps to get early feedback to catch bugs and improve behavior quickly, meaning more Firefox users overall have a better experience.
    - Users in the United States can now trigger weather suggestions in the address bar! Simply type a weather-related term or a city name, and view the result directly in the address bar dropdown.

      Currently available in: United States

    - Tab Groups, a new way to organize and take control of your tabs, is now available to almost all users worldwide. You can create a group by dragging one tab onto another, pausing, then dropping it. You can also now reposition a tab group on the tab bar by dragging it.
    - Firefox on Windows 11 now uses acrylic-style menus for popup windows, which better match the operating system’s aesthetic.
    - You can now copy links from background tabs using the tabstrip context menu on MacOS and Linux.
    Fixed
    - Various security fixes.
    Changed
    - Improved the address and credit card autofill experience to better handle forms that update dynamically as users input information. Autofill now correctly fills newly revealed fields—such as those shown after selecting a country.
    - Rededicated previous color settings to Contrast Control settings. (Learn more)
    Enterprise
    - You can find information about policy updates and enterprise specific bug fixes in the Firefox for Enterprise 138 Release Notes.
    Developer
    - Added support for the import map integrity field, allowing you to ensure the integrity of dynamically or statically imported modules.
    - Implemented support for Error.isError, enabling brand checks to determine whether an object is an instance of Error. (Learn more)
    - Added support for the error.captureStackTrace extension to improve compatibility with other browsers. (Learn more)
    - A new column has been added to the Network panel to display the full path of the request URL. This enhancement makes helps developers quickly view and analyze complete request paths.
    - Firefox now applies a uniform user agent (UA) style to <h1> elements, regardless of whether they are used inside <article>, <aside>, <nav>, or <section>. (Learn more)

    Web Platform
    - Added support for Import Attributes, allowing developers to specify additional metadata when importing modules.
    - Applications can now set their preferred degradation method to be used when the configured frame rate and resolution cannot be maintained. (Learn more)
    - Firefox now enables the cache directive for the Clear-Site-Data header, allowing websites to clear the network cache. This gives websites more control over stored data, such as clearing the cache during logout to help mitigate privacy risks. (Learn more)
    Unresolved
    - Due to recent changes in Chrome on Windows, some users might find that the Firefox migration wizard no longer successfully imports passwords from Chrome or Chrome-based browsers. As a workaround, you can export your passwords as a CSV file from Chrome and then import them into Firefox using either the migration wizard or the Firefox password manager.
