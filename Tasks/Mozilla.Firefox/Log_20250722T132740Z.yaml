    New
    - Now Firefox can help you keep your tabs organized, automatically. A local AI model identifies similar tabs, automatically organizes them into groups, and even suggests group names. Everything happens on your device to respect your privacy. Learn more here.

      This feature is part of a progressive roll out.
      What is a progressive roll out?
      Certain new Firefox features are released gradually. This means some users will see the feature before everyone does. This approach helps to get early feedback to catch bugs and improve behavior quickly, meaning more Firefox users overall have a better experience.
    - Vertical tabs users can now adjust the size of the tools areas at the bottom of the sidebar. To see fewer tools and more tabs, drag down the divider line which pushes extra tools into an overflow menu.

    - On Linux, Firefox uses less memory and no longer requires a forced restart after an update has been applied by a package manager.
    - Address autofill has been enabled for users in Brazil, Spain and Japan.
    - The Firefox address bar can now be used as a unit converter. The unit converter supports converting units of length, temperature, mass, force, and angular measurement, as well as timezones (e.g. “now in GMT” , “10am EDT to CET”). Selecting the result will copy it to your clipboard.

    - Firefox builds in Valencian now come with a built-in Catalan (Valencian variant) dictionary for the Firefox spellchecker.
    - The following languages are now available for translation:
      - Albanian
      - Gujarati
      - Hebrew
      - Hindi
      - Kannada
      - Malay
      - Malayalam
      - Persian
      - Telugu

    Developer
    - Firefox will now also clear the back-forward-cache when receiving the Clear-Site-Data: "cache" response header.
    Web Platform
    - Enabled the WebGPU API (spec; MDN) on Windows. For details, see the Mozilla Graphics Team Blog.
    - Implemented the closedby attribute and it's related closedBy property on dialogs indicating the types of user actions that can be used to close the associated <dialog> element.
    - Support for Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS) is now re-enabled, allowing developers to opt a cookie into storage partitioning per top-level site.
    - The HTMLElement.showPopover() and HTMLElement.togglePopover() methods now take an options.source argument referencing the popover invoker, and togglePopover() also takes a force resp. options.force argument to force the popover open or closed.
