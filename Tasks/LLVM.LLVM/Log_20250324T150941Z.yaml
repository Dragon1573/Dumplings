    - Fixed an issue about implicit device attributes of virtual destructors which causes undefined symbols for CUDA/HIP programs which use std::string as class members with C++20 and MSVC.
    - Fix a performance regression related to computed gotos, which usually affects interpreter projects. If you are using Clang 19, adding -mllvm -tail-dup-pred-size=100000 should restore the original performance.
    - Fixes building LLDB with ncurses support when terminfo symbols are provided in a separate tinfo library.
