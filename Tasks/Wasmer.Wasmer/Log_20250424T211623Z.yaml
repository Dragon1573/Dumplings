    This stable release adds support for the exception handling proposal on Linux and Darwin platforms when using LLVM, adds a new LLVM-specific optimization (--enable-pass-params-opt), allows for multiple heterogeneous backends to be embedded in the same Wasmer build (--llvm, --cranelift, --singlepass, --v8, --wamr, --wasmi), adds support for process spawning without asyncify via full support for posix_spawn in wasix-libc with the new proc_spawn2 syscall, a number of QoL improvements to CLI commands and WASIX and much more.
