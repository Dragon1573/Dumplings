    Alphas
    - The card table filters have been integrated into the main filter system! You can also now filter by card metadata throughout RemNote.

    - Added a native FSRS scheduler! This is in alpha and weâ€™ll be continuing to polish this up.
      - The main advantages of the native FSRS scheduler are:
        - Works offline
        - Faster
        - Fully works with the exam scheduler
        - We hope to enable weight optimization in the app.
    - Please share feedback in Discord for both - thanks!
