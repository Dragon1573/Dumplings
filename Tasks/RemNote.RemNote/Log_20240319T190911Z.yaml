    You can now add hints to clozes and the front / back of your cards!
    - In a cloze, type (( or /hint to add a hint.
    - On a front-back card, type /front hint or /back hint

    Note - if you find yourself needing to add a hint, thereâ€™s a good chance that your card is too complicated and could be split up into multiple simpler cards.
