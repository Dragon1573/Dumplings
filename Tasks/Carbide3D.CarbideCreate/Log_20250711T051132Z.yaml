    - (FIX) Reorder the default colors for a new layer.
    - (FIX) DXF parser now accepts absurdly old MacOS 9 line endings.
    - (NEW) Replaced the Layer menu entry with a popup to notify users of the change.
    - (NEW) Changed the align command so it doesn't return immediately, giving you the chance to try different options.
    - (PRO) Added Stock to Leave for 3D finishing so it can be used as a semi-roughing, if desired.
