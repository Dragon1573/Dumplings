    ReNamer 7.8 has been released.
    This is another big update that brings several new features and some under-the-hood improvements.
    New features:
    1. Implement the Mapping rule. Use this rule to map old filenames to new filenames.
    2. Add an option to export names and new names to clipboard. These can be be loaded directly into a Mapping rule.
    3. Improvements for the Reformat Date rule: Unicode word boundaries, pass-through quoted text in date patterns, improved performance, add ISO date-time formats to the dropdown options.
    4. Display detailed information about the character at the caret position in the Analyze window.
    The new Mapping rule allows you to map old filenames to new filenames, which can be externally managed and loaded into the rule via clipboard or CSV file. It also allows you to capture the current set of files and their generated new names as a rule set, which could then also be applied to a different set of files.

    For example, imagine that you have a list of audio files from an album but the filenames contain only the track numbers, and you also have a list of full song titles. With the new Mapping rule you can create a mapping to convert track numbers into to the corresponding full song titles, like shown above.
    The improved Analyze dialog can now identify complex Unicode characters. This can be especially useful when dealing with characters that are visually indistinguishable from other characters. Here is a quick demo of how it looks:

    Maintenance and other changes:
    - Optimized implementation of renaming rules.
    - Fix: The rules list is loosing focus after moving rules. Issue introduced in v7.7.
    - Gracefully handle errors when generating rule statements. Prevent bogus rule configurations from breaking the main user interface.
    - Updated language files: French, Turkish, Portuguese (Brazil), Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Russian.
