    Improvements

    - Default 1080p video: 1080p video is now turned on by default for internal Rooms meetings. Rooms will automatically send and receive 1080p video for clearer visuals and improved communication during meetings. You can turn 1080p video on or off in the controller video settings.
    - Support for Poly/HP Elite Mini 800 G9 Desktop PC: You can run Room meetings with reliable audio, video, and screen sharing quality on your Poly/HP Elite Mini 800 G9 Desktop PC. We recommend using this PC with an iPad or Samsung Galaxy controller and a Jabra PanaCast 50 (with EPTZ).
