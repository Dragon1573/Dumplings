    üÜï Action Sharing
    Have you ever wanted to share a single action with a friend or colleague? Well, now you can. With Action Sharing, you can export an action from Stream Deck and share it like any other file. You can share key and dial actions, folders, Multi Actions, and more.
    Exporting an action is easy‚Äîdrag an action from a key or dial onto your desktop or into a folder, or right-click and select ‚ÄúExport‚Äù.
    When someone sends you an action, drag the action from your file manager directly onto a key, or right-click on a key and select ‚ÄúImport‚Äù.

    üÜï Action Trigger for Stream Deck +
    Turn up the power of your dials to 11! See what we did there? Put simply, Action Triggers enable you to assign key actions to dials, and trigger those actions with a clockwise turn, counterclockwise turn, or dial press. So any plugin and action can work with the dials, even if they don‚Äôt have built-in dial support!
