    📌 Pinned actions and folders
    Got essential actions or folders that repeat across all your pages? Next time, skip the setup and pin it instead. A pinned action appears on corresponding keys across all pages, as long as it’s unused. When you edit a pinned action, the changes sync automatically across each instance. Of course, you can always overwrite a pinned action by replacing it with another action.
    Select your profile’s pinned page to start adding actions.

    🆕 Page backgrounds
    With a few clicks, set a custom background image that covers every key, like a wallpaper, of a page. Images appear in the backdrop of keys, so you can still layer transparent icons and text over top.
    To start customizing, right-click any key and select Set from file to upload a background image.

    🎨 Default backgrounds
    Once you set a custom background, you can apply it across the entire profile. This means it will appear in all pages and folders, unless it’s overwritten or a background already exists.
    To make a page background the default, right-click any key and select Use current as default.

    🌆 Animated screensavers
    Stepping away from your desk? Now you can set a single animated GIF as your device screensaver. No more wasted time setting up dedicated GIF profiles. Now it’s as easy as a few clicks.

    🪟 Style your standby
    Now you can customize the image that appears when Stream Deck boots up. Called a “Standby Screen,” this image also appears when your device is powered on but disconnected from the Stream Deck app.
    To set your Standby Screen, open Preferences then select the Devices tab. Choose the device you want to customize, then select Advanced.

    🆕 Default profiles
    Each Stream Deck now comes with a default profile, making setup fast and easy out of the box. These profiles include common, essential actions like taking a screenshot, adjusting volume, and opening apps. They also feature links to helpful videos, so beginners can learn the basics of Stream Deck.
    These profiles only display when connecting a new device for the first time.

    🎮 SCUF Envision support
    Now PC gamers can use the 5 macro keys on their SCUF Envision controller with Stream Deck*. Great for controlling livestreams, toggling push-to-talk in Discord, or streamlining in-game hotkeys—all without ever leaving the action.
    *Requires CORSAIR iCUE software

    📖 Page changes
    Managing your pages is easier than ever with these quality-of-life changes:
    - You can now copy and paste entire pages with ease
    - Want to transform a folder into its own page, or vice versa? Just copy and paste your folder as a new page, or copy your page and paste it onto the canvas to turn it into a folder.

    🛠️ Bug fixes and performance improvements
    - We made profile saving more reliable and added automatic backup and recovery in the event of data loss
    - You can once again access network folders, such as “\server\videos”, using the Open action
    - We improved messaging to make it clear that a Marketplace account is required to update plugins
    - Updated the style and color of some views to be consistent with app UI design on Windows
