    - Improved the matrix representation in the variables pane. #3656
    - Added new python.interpreters.include and python.interpreters.exclude settings to include additional Python interpreter search directories or exclude Python interpreters from the UI. #3574
    - Show summary statistics in Data Explorer for pandas columns with mixed data types. #3401
    - Note if a language session was used when making the Positron update check. #6388
