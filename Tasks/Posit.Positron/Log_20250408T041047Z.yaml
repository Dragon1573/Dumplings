    New Features
    - [#6533, #6902, #6997, #7005, #7070, #7083, #7087] Made yet further improvements to our experimental multisession console support (especially in managing LSPs); read more at #6712 for how to opt in.
    - [#6811] Python 3.8 has reached end-of-life and is no longer supported.

    - [#4263] Improved Python language server support for notebooks.
    - [#6941] Updated the WSL launcher script to support kv9898.open-remote-wsl, a community-maintained Positron-compatible WSL extension. Thank you, @kv9898!
    - [#6270] Python interpreters installed at /opt/python or included via interpreter settings are no longer tagged as "Unknown".
    - [#4630] We now display a loading indicator for the small histogram/frequency table sparkline plots in the Data Explorer.
