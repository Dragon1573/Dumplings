    Good Afternoon Everyone,
    We're closing in on the end of the year and I somehow managed to get out one more 2023 release of Icaros. This time I'm skipping the Beta phase, as I don't believe any of the changes will cause any regressions. Check the changelog for all the details.
    I hope you've all had a wonderful fall, and as always thank you all so much for the donations, troubleshooting and help with the translations! ❤️
    I hope you all enjoy the new release!
