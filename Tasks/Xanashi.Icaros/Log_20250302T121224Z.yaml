    Good Afternoon Everyone,
    I have a slightly smaller release for you today.
    It mainly focuses on updating libraries and fixing a number a bugs, that was reported on the issue tracker.
    I consider the release completely stable, however I'm currently replacing the motherboard of my main
    development machine (it was unfortunately faulty), so I couldn't run all the usual tests before this release.
    So just to be on the safe side, I'm making todays release a Beta release.
    I also just counted up the donations from 2024, so I could share the final amount with all of you as I like to do,
    and I was honestly blown away. Icaros has never had this many donations over the span of a year.
    I am so grateful for all your support, and I can't thank all of you enough for helping me with
    donations, feedback, translations and troubleshooting.
    Total donation amount in 2024:
    $636
    Thank you all so incredibly much! ❤️
    I hope you all enjoy the new release!
