    Good Afternoon Everyone,
    I apologize once again for the long time periods between releases. I've been dealing with a lot of IRL things, that has made it hard to find time to work on Icaros.
    I still have some nice features like SVG and PDF thumbnailing in the works, but for today you will have to settle with a slightly smaller release.
    As always for full transparency, here is what Icaros earned in donations last year: 2023 - $471
    I can't thank you enough for all the donations, and wonderful feedback. And I always appreciate all the help with troubleshooting bugs and as well as the effort put in by the translators! ❤️
    I hope you've all had a great 2024 so far, and I hope you all enjoy the new release!
