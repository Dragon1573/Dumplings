    Good Afternoon Everyone,
    I have another release today, adding thumbnailing support for EPS and INDD files, and a fix for the thumbnailing of 'tiled' HEIC files, that was reported with the previous Beta.
    Be sure to report any bugs or regressions as always.
    I hope you all enjoy the new release and have a wonderful summer! ❤️

    Icaros v.3.3.3 Beta 2
    - Added support for thumbnailing 'tiled' HEIC files (Fixes 'zoomed in' thumbnails for HEIC files)
    - Added thumbnailing support of EPS files with an embedded preview
    - Added thumbnailing support of INDD files with an embedded preview
    - Added AI, EPS, and INDD to the 'Common' and 'Most Known' presets
    - Improved thumbnailing of AI files
    - AI, EPS and INDD are now registered as image formats
