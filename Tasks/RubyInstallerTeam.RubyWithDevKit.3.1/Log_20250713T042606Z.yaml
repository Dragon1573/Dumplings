    Changed
    - Update to ruby-3.1.7, see release notes.
    - Apply all security patches that Canonical provides for Ubuntu-20.04 because version 1.1.1 is out of maintanence from the OpenSSL project:
      - CVE-2024-2511
      - CVE-2024-4741
      - CVE-2024-5535
      - CVE-2024-9143
      - CVE-2024-13176
    - Fix automatic pacman package install when using bundler-2.5.x. #396
    - Fix pacman install error in parallel bundler install -jX. #403
      pacman invocation is now serialized to avoid locking errors.
    - Update MSYS2 download version to 2024-12-08 for ridk install 1. #402
    - Add junction (directory link) at <ruby>/ssl, which allows to easily find the OpenSSL certificates directory. #399
      The certificates directory varies between ruby versions and the junction unifies the location.
      It is described in <ruby>/ssl/README-SSL.md.
    - Update the SSL CA certificate list.
    - Remove installed gems and MSYS2 by the uninstaller per default. #408
      So far the uninstaller only removed the ruby install files, but kept installed gems and MSYS2.
      The old behaviour is available when running the uninstaller with option /allfiles=no.
      See in the wiki.
      This is to prepare RubyInstaller for the Microsoft Store.
    - Avoid early load of etc.so allowing updates of etc.gem. #388
    - Set a single key in gemrc to allow appending to this file. #388
