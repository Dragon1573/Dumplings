    Logtalk compiler and runtime
    - ADDED: Predicate property recursive to the reflection API to document that a predicate definition includes at least one recursive rule.
    - ADDED: Linter warnings for logtalk::print_message/3 goals (specifically, missing message tokenization and misuse of Format+Arguments meta-message).
    Documentation
    - ADDED: Also generate ePub and PDF versions of the APIs documentation.
    - IMPROVED: Documentation of the code_metrics tool.
    Library
    - ADDED: New and improved tests for the os library.
    - FIXED: The os library date_time/7 predicate for XSB to return the local date and time.
    Tools
    - CHANGED: The code_metrics tool to exclude auxiliary predicates from analysis.
    - CHANGED: The diagrams tool to omit from library loading and library dependency diagrams libraries that are not loaded or have no dependencies.
    - CHANGED: The diagrams tool to omit from directory loading and directory dependency diagrams directories that are not loaded or have no dependencies.
    - CHANGED: The diagrams tool to use the default layout for sub-diagrams when using the zoom(true) option.
    - CHANGED: The packs tool to only install or restore, by default, packs that are compatible with the current Logtalk, backed, and operating-system versions. Add a new compatible/1 boolean option for the install/4, update/3, and restore/2 predicates (default is true) to allow overriding the new default behavior.
    - ADDED: Support to the packs tool for specifying packs alternative dependencies using the (;)/2 operator.
    - ADDED: New public predicates to the code_metrics tool that take a list of options to selectively exclude from analysis libraries, directories, files, and entities.
    - ADDED: The diagrams tool directory diagrams now generate file nodes that link to file entity diagrams when using the zoom(true) option.
    - ADDED: New diagrams tool recursive_relations/1 boolean option (default is false) to output recursive calls links in predicate cross-referencing diagrams.
    - ADDED: New diagrams tool versions/1 boolean option (default is false) to print the Logtalk and backend version data.
    - ADDED: New diagrams tool predicate_url_target_format/1 option (default is sphinx) to allow generating correct documentation URL predicate targets.
    - ADDED: Preliminary support for Mermaid to the diagrams tool (not loaded by default as its current version lacks parity with required Graphviz features).
    - IMPROVED: The packs tool now checks when updating a pack if any dependent pack will break.
    - FIXED: The packs tool to pass pack installing and updating options to any required dependencies that must also be installed or updated.
    - FIXED: The diagrams tool to normalize the directories listed in the exclude_directories/1 option.
    - FIXED: The diagrams tool to always consider the exclude options when outputting external nodes and edges.
    - FIXED: The diagrams tool to avoid adding zoom icons/links when the linked diagrams are empty.
    - FIXED: The diagrams tool to show relative paths in external file nodes after the omit_path_prefixes/1 option instead of just basenames.
    - FIXED: The lgtunit tool xUnit.net v2 XML format support to output errors quoted.
    Tests
    - ADDED: Preliminary test set for the Prolog encoding/1 directive supported by some of the backends that support Unicode and multiple text encodings.
    - ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog standard number_codes/2 predicate.
