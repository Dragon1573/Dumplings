    Logtalk compiler and runtime
    - FIXED: Regression in the logtalk_make/1 predicate check target where the file location for a missing predicate reference would not be reported correctly.
    - FIXED: Don't print left-recursion linter warnings for coinductive predicates.
    - FIXED: Allow term-expansion to generate multiple entity definitions. Thanks to Alex Kouznetsov for the bug report.
    Documentation
    - IMPROVED: Handbook documentation of the term-expansion mechanism.
    Library
    - FIXED: Silence harmless left-recursion linter warning in the timeout library tests.
    Tools
    - CHANGED: The dead_code_scanner and lgtdoc tools to print warnings using the same format used by the compiler.
    - FIXED: The code_metrics tool computation of entity cyclomatic complexity to also consider multifile predicate definitions contributed by the entity to other entities when computing graph connected components.
    - FIXED: The code_metrics tool computation of entity Unique Predicate Nodes (UPN) to also count multifile predicate definitions contributed by the entity to other entities.
    - FIXED: Code coverage for tests of the Halstead complexity metric.
    - FIXED: Deleted dead code in the code_metrics and lgtdoc tools.
    - FIXED: The wrapper reporting of missing meta_predicate/1 directives. Thanks to Alex Kouznetsov for the bug report.
    Examples
    - FIXED: Silence harmless left-recursion linter warning in the tbbt example.
    - FIXED: Missing predicates in the relations example.
    IDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support
    - ADDED: VSCode support predicates for using the dead_code_scanner, make, and code_metrics tools and for recursively generating documentation and diagrams.
    - UPDATED: VSCode support predicates for running tests and doclets to add compiler warnings and errors to the "Problems" pane.
    - UPDATED: VSCode support predicates for running tests the VSCode to make the tests results available for code lens.
    - UPDATED: VSCode support predicate that finds the parent file of a loaded file to also work for included files.
    - FIXED: Avoid missing entity warnings when loading the VSCode support.
