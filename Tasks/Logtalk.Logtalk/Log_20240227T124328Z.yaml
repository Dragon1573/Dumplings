    Logtalk compiler and runtime
    - IMPROVED: Simplified implementation of the threaded_engine_destroy/1 built-in predicate.
    - FIXED: Workaround SWI-Prolog throwing existence errors when calling thread_signal/2 or thread_send_message/2` on a terminated but not yet joined thread.
    Prolog adapter and integration files
    - UPDATED: The Trealla Prolog adapter file to set the threads and engines flags to supported when running on a recent version providing the required built-in predicates.
    Documentation
    - IMPROVED: Handbook documentation of the threaded_engine_self/1 built-in predicate.
    - IMPROVED: Documentation of the arbitrary library.
    Library
    - ADDED: New os library predicates operating_system_name/1, operating_system_machine/1, and operating_system_release/1.
    - ADDED: New compound(Name,Types) and types_frequency(Pairs) types to the types and arbitrary libraries. Joint work with Yurii Rashkovskii.
    Tools
    - CHANGED: The lgtunit tool now prints both CPU time and wall time for tests.
    - CHANGED: The lgtunit tool xUnit reports now use the tests wall time instead of CPU time.
    - FIXED: The packs linter for pack definitions would not recognize the (\==)/2 operator as valid when specifying dependencies.
    Examples
    - ADDED: Additional test for the document_converter example.
    - ADDED: Tests for the tbbt threaded engine example.
    - IMPROVED: Tests for the barriers blackboard, buckets, buffer, checkpoint, metered_concurrency, philosophers, ping_pong, sorting, and team multi-threading examples by using explicit assertions.
    - IMPROVED: Portability of the whisper multi-threading example.
    - UPDATED: The buckets, buffer, metered_concurrency, tbbt, and whisper multi-threading examples to use the format library.
    - UPDATED: The buckets multi-threading example to call the thread_yield/0 predicate in the redistribute and match loops.
    - UPDATED: The ebench threading engines example tests for LVM.
    - FIXED: The threads/team example to allow running it independently of the current directory.
    Tests
    - ADDED: Test set for ISO Prolog standard logical update semantics.
    - ADDED: Additional test for the ISO Prolog standard op/3 predicate.
    - ADDED: Additional tests for the de facto Prolog standard format/2-3 predicates (~p control sequence).
