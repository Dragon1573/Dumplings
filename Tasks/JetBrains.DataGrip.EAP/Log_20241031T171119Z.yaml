    SQL error handling by AI Assistant
    We have implemented a couple of useful actions for handling SQL query execution errors with AI Assistant. Now, for each error message, DataGrip shows two actions on the far right-hand side of the error message: Explain with AI and Fix with AI.

    Explain with AI opens the AI chat, sends an automatic prompt, and gives you AI Assistant's explanation of the error.

    Fix with AI generates a fix for the query execution error in the editor.

    These two new actions work similarly to the Fix SQL Problem Under Caret and Explain SQL Problem Under Caret intention actions.
    This feature requires attaching the database schema to suggest proper explanations and fixes.
