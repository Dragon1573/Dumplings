    Improved Database tab in Search Everywhere popup
    We've enhanced the Database tab in the Search Everywhere popup! You can now filter search results by the database object type. Enter / followed by the object type, then type the object name. For example, entering /tables will result in a list of introspected database tables, and /tables film will find the tables that have "film" in their names.
