    We're starting the Early Access Program for DataGrip 2024.2 and, as usual, we invite you to try the latest features and improvements ahead of the official release.
    Let's take a look at what's inside the first EAP build.
    Geographical data viewer for tabular data files
    Our Geo viewer lets you explore the geographical data stored in CSV and XLSX files, as well as in files with other supported formats.

    [Snowflake] Support for Iceberg, dynamic, and hybrid tables
    Iceberg, dynamic, and hybrid Snowflake tables are now introspected and displayed in the database explorer.

    IDE macros for connection startup scripts
    It's now possible to use built-in macros in your connection startup scripts. To add a macro to the script, go to File | Data Sources, select your data source, and open the Options tab. Then navigate to Startup script and click Insert Macros.
    For example, if you need the OS username of the user who initiates a connection, you can use the OSUser macro in your script: ALTER SESSION SET QUERY_TAG = '$OSUser$'.

    Other improvements
    - DBE-19185: Various SSL key types are now supported.
    - DBE-20604: PAC proxies are now supported.
    - AI Assistant's performance with large database schemas has been improved.
