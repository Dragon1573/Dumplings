    [PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server] Introspection by levels
    We are expanding the implementation of introspection by levels to more databases - this time, PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server! DataGrip now automatically adjusts the amount of metadata loaded for these databases based on your database size. This means that for a larger database, you don't have to wait till all the metadata is loaded to start working with it.
