    Local filter in the data editor
    A long-awaited feature is finally here: you can now filter rows by values in columns.
    This will obviously not send a query to the database, so it's fast, but keep in mind that the filter affects only the current page. If you want to filter more information, just change the page size or even fetch all the data.
    If you want to turn off all the local filters on the current data editor, use this icon:
    And don't forget about the local text search function Ctrl/Cmd+F! It has been around for decades and can still be useful, especially if you only have a rough idea of the location of the data you're searching for.
    Moving columns in CSV files
    Starting from 2024.1, you can move columns in the data editor of a CSV file and these changes will be applied to the file itself.
    More features for UUIDs
    As per requests received in our issue tracker, we've put some of our efforts toward making it easier to work with UUIDs:
    - We added a new action: Generate UUID.
    - It is now possible to edit any column with UUIDs, including those represented by the binary(16), blob(16), and similar types.
    - [PostgreSQL] Values in UUID columns can now be validated while editing.
    Aligned code style for multi-row INSERTS
    You can now format multi-row INSERT statements with values aligned. The formatter will analyze the width of the values in each column and choose the most suitable width for the column.
    To turn this feature on, enable the option Align multi-row VALUES.
    DataGrip handles situations where certain values are much longer than others.
    The formatter will detect such values and make exceptions for them, moving the remaining fields to the next row.
    This behavior is managed by these three options:
    Column completion for GROUP BY clause
    Now DataGrip analyzes the aggregates used in the SELECT clause and offers you the appropriate column list along with the GROUP BY clause.
    Warning for WHERE TRUE clauses
    We expanded our unsafe query warning. It now warns you if you run the query with the WHERE TRUE condition or its variations. This can be a life-saver if you're someone who likes having this clause for debugging purposes but occasionally forgets to change it!
