    [MySQL, MariaDB] Fragment introspection and smart refresh
    DataGrip now supports fragment introspection for MySQL and MariaDB databases. With this feature supported, the smart refresh mechanism is now available for these databases, as well. Smart refresh allows the IDE to analyze which objects could potentially be modified by the query and refresh only those specific objects.
    [Oracle Database] Auto-completion for the named parameters list
    For Oracle databases, you now can use auto-completion for the named parameters list when calling a method with parameters. To do this, invoke the auto-completion popup by pressing Ctrl+Space, select the option that lists all parameters, and press Enter to insert it. Then, press Tab to go through the parameters.

    [Google BigQuery] Table-valued functions support
    We have improved the support for table-valued functions in BigQuery. Now, DataGrip properly detects both the TVFs and their return columns.
