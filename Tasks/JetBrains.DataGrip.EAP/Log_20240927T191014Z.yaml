    Text-to-SQL: in-editor diff for generated results
    We have improved the experience of asking AI Assistant questions in the editor.

    Now, when you ask AI Assistant to do something with a chunk of code, the editor area contains a diff with both the original and the generated code. AI Assistant's suggestions are highlighted with a different color and marked with the Revert icon in the gutter. You can also edit the resulting query yourself in the same area. Your changes are highlighted the same way.
    For example, you can ask AI Assistant to retrieve more data with a query and then add an ORDER BY clause to the generated result.

    Floating paging
    To make the grid paging more noticeable in our data editor, we have moved it from the data editor tab toolbar to the bottom center.

    In-editor results width
    Previously, the width of the in-editor results grid was limited. Now, the grid adjusts to use the full width of your editor, allowing you to view more data.

    Inspection for an excessive number of JOIN clauses
    In certain cases, it is forbidden to run a query that contains an excessive number of JOIN clauses due to performance degradation. The editor can now identify and highlight such queries.
    You can enable this inspection in the IDE settings. To do so, navigate to Editor | Inspections, expand the SQL section, and select Excessive JOIN count.
