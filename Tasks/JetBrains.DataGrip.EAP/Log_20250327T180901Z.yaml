    Support for more cutting-edge LLMs
    JetBrains AI Assistant is leveling up! We've added support for Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Haiku, provisioned in Amazon Bedrock. This means sharper responses, faster insights, and an even smoother experience.
    We're also expanding the lineup of LLMs used by AI Assistant to include OpenAI's o1, o1-mini, and o3-mini, providing more versatility and speed. Whether you need deep analysis or quick yet well-considered insight, AI Assistant in DataGrip is up to the task like never before!
    Support for loading full cell values in place
    DataGrip has a setting that limits the amount of data that's loaded in each cell. This is designed to improve performance when there is too much data in your tables. Partially loaded cells look like this:
    But in some cases, you need to load all of the data, and now that's possible! To do this, hover over the cell and click Reload Cell on the quick actions popup toolbar.
    [SQL Server] .NET JDBC driver by JetBrains: Shared memory support
    This JDBC driver was initially developed by the Rider team. From this release, it's also available in DataGrip.
    The main feature of this driver is its support for the shared memory protocol. This protocol is used by clients to connect to the SQL Server instance that is running on the same machine. SQL Server's shared memory protocol is the simplest protocol, as it has no configurable settings that need to be tuned in order to use it.
    [Oracle, SQLite] Suggestion to switch to single session mode when using temporary tables
    When creating temporary tables, DataGrip now suggests you switch to single session mode. This mode will allow you to see these tables in the database explorer.
