    Ability to attach database objects to the AI chat
    The database context you provide to the AI chat can now be more specific. Previously, only the whole schema could be attached. Now, you can attach the database object you need to work with - for example, a table or a view. This can be particularly useful when you're working with larger schemas.
    To attach a database object, type @ or # in the input field, select or type dbObject:, then select the object you want to attach from the list.

    Cloud-based code completion
    DataGrip now supports cloud-based code completion. It uses cloud resources to offer more precise code completion, leveraging greater computational power than local resources can provide. This feature allows the IDE to autocomplete single lines, blocks of code, and even entire scripts in real time based on the available context. The generated SQL is similar to how you would write your statements, matching your style and naming conventions.
    With cloud-based code completion, DataGrip shows suggestions in the editor as you type, and you can also invoke them by pressing Option + Shift + \ (macOS) or Alt + Shift + \ (Windows/Linux). To disable this feature, go to Settings | Editor | General | Inline Completion, and then deselect the Enable cloud completion suggestions checkbox.
    To use the cloud-based code completion feature, you need to have the AI Assistant plugin installed in your IDE. Once the plugin is installed, the feature is enabled by default.

    Editable results for SELECT queries with JOIN clauses
    After a decade in the works, this long-awaited feature is here! Previously, the result set grid for the SELECT queries with JOIN clauses was read-only. Now, you can run such queries, view the result set, and then edit cell values right in the query results grid. To do this, simply double-click a cell or select it and press Enter. Also, just as in any other grid, you can right-click the cell and select Open in Value Editor to edit the value in a separate pane that opens on the right.
    The data editor allows you to edit the values both in the in-editor results and in the Services tool window. Once you edit a cell value, the following buttons become active on the Result tab's toolbar in the Services tool window: Revert Selected, Preview Pending Changes, Submit.

    An additional toolbar with those buttons also appears at the bottom of the in-editor results pane.

    When you submit your changes to the database, DataGrip displays the DML Preview dialog for you to check the generated statements first. To edit your changes, click Cancel and proceed with editing. To submit the changes, click Submit.

    This feature is not supported for the SQL UNION operator, table self-join operation results, result sets with calculation result columns (for example, CONCAT), or NoSQL databases. To ensure proper results, the feature also requires a way to uniquely identify rows.
    Grid heatmap
    In the data editor, DataGrip now provides grid heatmaps with two color-scheme options, Diverging and Sequential. To enable the heatmap for your grid, click Table Coloring Options on the toolbar and select one of the schemes.
    The Diverging color scheme emphasizes variation relative to a norm. It consists of two contrasting colors that deviate from a central value in two opposite directions.

    The Sequential color scheme consists of a single color or a range of closely related colors that vary in intensity.

    You can apply the heatmap color schemes to the whole table or to each column separately, or you can use coloring only for Boolean values.
    One action for clearing all local filters in a grid
    Now, you can clear the local filter for all columns in your grid using just one action. To do this, invoke the Find Action popup by pressing Cmd + Shift + A (macOS) or Ctrl + Shift + A (Windows/Linux), start typing Clear Local Filter For All Columns, and then select the action from the list.
