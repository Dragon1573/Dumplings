    FLS now supports the option in JetBrains Account to enable or disable the AI Assistant plugin.
    If enabled for your organization, the AI Assistant plugin will be available to use in all IDEs activated with a license from your FLS. Disabling the AI Assistant in your JetBrains Account will make it unavailable.
    If you continue to use a previous version of FLS that does not support this option, the AI Assistant will be disabled in your organization regardless of your JetBrains Account settings.
