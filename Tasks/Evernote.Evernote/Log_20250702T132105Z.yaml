    New features:
    - A major update to Search is being rolled out. It now opens front and center for better focus, offers smarter and more relevant suggestions as you type, and features a refreshed default view that highlights recent and recommended content, making it faster and easier to find what you need.
    - You can now show or hide the note list using the button in the top-left corner of your note. Or use the shortcut CMD/CTRL + Alt + V to switch between views.
    - Shared notes now show a "Shared with me" section in the breadcrumb at the top of the note.

    Fixes:
    - Fixed an issue where the selected task priority wasn't properly highlighted and could not be removed
    - Fixed an issue that prevented the app from scrolling to the correct result when the match was found in the note title
    - Fixed an issue that affected typing inside text fields in Japanese and Korean
    - Fixed an issue that occasionally caused sidebar preferences to reset unexpectedly
    - Fixed an issue where clicking on a pinned note in a Space would incorrectly redirect users to the Home screen
