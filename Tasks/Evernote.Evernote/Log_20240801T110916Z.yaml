    Fixes:
    - Fixes an issue where note shortcuts incorrectly worked on home screen with pinned note widget. Now, they only work when the note is open.
    - Fixes an issue where setting or editing a task due date made the option modal unresponsive. It's all smooth now.
    - Fixes an issue where notes in read-only shared notebooks didn't always display the header.
