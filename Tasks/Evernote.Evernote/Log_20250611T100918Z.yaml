    New features:
    - When moving a note, you can now directly create new notebooks or spaces from the dialogue!

    Fixes:
    - Fixed an issue where creating a new note in a Space brought the user to the note list instead of staying in the Space.
    - Fixed an issue where navigating to notes after performing a search opened the note without its relative note list.
    - Fixed an issue that caused customization preferences to reset unexpectedly.
