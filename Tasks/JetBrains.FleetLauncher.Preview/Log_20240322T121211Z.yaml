    Fleet 1.32 Release Notes
    Here are some noteworthy changes:
    - Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Dockerfile, and Bash files can now be run without a project.
    - The new Run Current File functionality makes it easy to run and debug scripts in certain languages.
    - Fleet 1.32 comes with the ability to change line endings.
    - You can now quickly sort lines alphabetically in Fleet.
    - Fleet 1.32 reduces the double shift delay, meaning youâ€™ll no longer open the Search Everywhere interface accidentally when using the IntelliJ Platform keymap.
    - It is now easier to find the Replace feature after opening the Find window. A Toggle replace tooltip appears when hovering over the arrow on the left-hand side of the search bar.
    We've also fixed a number of bugs:
    - Collapsed tabs are no longer broken.
    - Close other tabs works as expected and closes all other tabs.
    - The workspaces menu is a more manageable size.
    - Add Caret Above/Below properly ignores automatic line breaks.
    See full release notes for the details about all the changes.
