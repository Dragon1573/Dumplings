    Fleet 1.36 Release Notes
    Here are some noteworthy changes:
    - We’ve improved syntax highlighting for PHP, C/C++, and Svelte for enhanced code readability.
    - With Fleet 1.36, syntax highlighting for PHP works, even when Smart Mode is disabled. We’ve also added highlighting for escaping strings, variables, properties, attributes, and more.
    - If you are working with C/C++, you’ll notice that we’ve added highlighting for attributes, too.
    - We’ve also improved syntax highlighting for Svelte elements such as <svelte:head>, <svelte:options>, <svelte:body>, etc.
    - In addition, we’ve made connecting to a remote server via SSH quicker and easier. With Fleet 1.36, the Fleet URL handler will support connecting to SSH directly using URLs of the following format: fleet://fleet.ssh/<hostname>?<query_params>. Now, only the hostname is required. If some parameters are not specified, Fleet will try to use the closest known match from previous connections or otherwise fall back to default values.
    - We’ve also made the setup of remote SSH connections faster, significantly reducing startup times for connections that are already known to hosts.
    - Fleet 1.36 introduces a new shortcut to apply a primary quick-fix. Use ⌥⇧↵ on macOS or Alt+Shift+Enter on Windows to use the feature when in the Problems view.
    - Good news for Android users: We’ve improved the Logcat color scheme.
    - For multiplatform projects, composable calls are now also highlighted in non-Android sources.
    - Override actions now retain the Compose annotation.
    - Extract Method refactorings on composable functions are now context-aware and don't add a composable annotation if this is not required.
    - Saved scratch files are now shown in recent files.
    We've also fixed a number of bugs:
    - When using Alt+Enter, the search field no longer disappears if there’s no match [FL-16899].
    - The terminal now stops after the window is closed [FL-21743].
    - There are no longer indenting issues when pasting Java multiline comments [FL-25998].
    - 127.0.0.1 is no longer shown instead of an actual IP address when connected via SSH [FL-23890].
