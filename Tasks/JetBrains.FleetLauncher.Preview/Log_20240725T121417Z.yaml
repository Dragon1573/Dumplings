    Fleet 1.38 Release Notes
    Here are some noteworthy changes:
    - With Fleet 1.38, existing Conda environments will be detected automatically. To use this feature, Conda must be installed in a known directory or added to the PATH variable. Alternatively, you can manually specify the Conda executable using the conda.executable settings key.
    - You can now reopen previously closed tabs with the ⌘⇧T / Ctrl+Shift+T shortcut.
    - Fleet 1.38 detects your operating system’s proxy configuration automatically, making it easier to use Fleet behind a firewall or on corporate networks.
    - Log files are now refreshed in real time. File changes are automatically updated and will be shown in open log files in the editor.
    - With Fleet 1.38, we’ve introduced a lock icon that indicates a file is read-only.
    - Every tool window such as Git, Debug, or Docker will now reopen when Fleet restarts.
    - When using remote workspaces in Fleet, Clone from Git can now clone to the remote workspace.
    - You can now use keyboard shortcuts to copy revision details in the History tool window.
    - We’ve made multiple improvements for configuring Python interpreters, including Pipenv and Poetry. Pipenv and Poetry can now be installed via quick-fix. We’ve also updated notifications about Pipenv and Poetry being missing from PATH. Furthermore, Fleet now displays the actual Poetry error messages which helps you identify potential issues.
    We've also fixed several bugs:
    - The bottom split panel no longer closes when you open a new tool [FL-25489].
    - After you rename a file, the file’s permissions no longer change [FL-21045].
    - Remove unused imports now works as intended [FL-23572].
