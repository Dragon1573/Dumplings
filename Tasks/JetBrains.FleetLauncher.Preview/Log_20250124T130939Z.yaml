    Fleet 1.45 Release Notes
    Here are some noteworthy improvements and bug fixes:
    - Fleet now supports auto-import for Gradle projects . This feature can be disabled by going to Settings | Tools | Gradle and clicking Automatically import project model when build script is saved.
    - Renaming files will now automatically update the file references. For Kotlin and Java, it also updates package names accordingly.
    - You can now preview Markdown scratch files without closing and opening the tab, and without saving the file. You can also preview Markdown files after opening them with the context menu and without saving the file. You can also preview Markdown files after (right-clicking the .md file and going to Open with Fleet).
    - Indents now work as expected with soft-wrapping.
    We've also fixed several bugs:
    - When using the Debug tool in Fleet, hidden frames can now be shown [FL-26222].
    - When using the Android device manager, the entered information after creating a new device is now saved when switching to another tab [FL-30167].
