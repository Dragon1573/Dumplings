    Fleet 1.40 Release Notes
    Here are some noteworthy changes:
    - Fleet 1.40 introduces Compose Preview for Android. You can now leverage powerful preview customization tools from Android Studio in Android sources such as multi-preview, parameter providers, and annotation options.
    - Along with previews for Android code, we’ve also added the option to render Android previews from common code. For projects with both Android and regular JVM targets, there is now a choice of which platform to render against (Android or Desktop).
    - We’ve added inlay hints for generating documentation for PHP and Groovy. Fleet already supported this feature for Java, Kotlin, and JavaScript. Just type /** and press Enter to bring up the Generate Documentation option, and then press ⌥↵ / Alt+Enter to show the tooltip.
    - Fleet 1.40 introduces a new shortcut for the Build & Refresh action when running Android Preview. Use ⌥⇧⌘R on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+F5 on Windows to use the feature.
    - We’re introducing a new action to the context menu and the Goto popup: New Terminal with Profile…. This opens the Terminal Profile popup. Now you can select the profile when opening a new terminal.
    - The Generate Code template is now hidden when the user is logged out.
    - When generating code with AI Assistant, the editor now scrolls along with the generated content.
    We've also fixed several bugs:
    - Undoing the renaming of a file no longer deletes the file [FL-27850].
    - Soft wraps now work correctly in the diff viewer [FL-19723].
    - Gradle run configurations are now executed successfully, even when passing parameters with spaces [FL-28619].
    - The Git Push action is now available after creating a new branch with a new commit [FL-27285].
    - Using Page Up and Page Down quickly now scrolls as expected [FL-23471].
    - Keymap file does not support trailing commas [FL-18020].
    - GotoKeymapItem action doesnt work from welcome screen [FL-28721].
