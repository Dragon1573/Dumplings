  Value: |-
    - Texmaker 6.x versions are designed for Qt6 (Qt5 support is deprecated and will no more be tested)
    - reorganization of the source files
    - switch to cmake for build system (a qmake .pro file is still available in the qmake_deprecated subdirectory but should no more work in the future)
    - macosx packages are now built for arm64 architecture (Mx chipsets)
    - a critical bug that happens on windows with large files has been fixed (limitation of calling a recursive function with msvc)
    - a bug related to the bad detection of % !TEX root = has been fixed
    - the obsolete "svn helper" has been replaced by "git helper"
    - texmaker now tries to use the devicePixelRatio of the screen corresponding to the window of the pdf document instead of qApp->devicePixelRatio() (in case of use of a second screen for the pdf viewer)
    - on gtk based desktop, texmaker now tries first to detect the gtk4 theme and see if the corresponding theme is available for Qt
    - key pressed detection in presentation wiew for the pdf has been completed
