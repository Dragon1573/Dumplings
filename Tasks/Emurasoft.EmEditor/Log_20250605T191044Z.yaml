    Today, we are releasing EmEditor v25.1.3.
    v25.1.3 includes the following bug fixes. Please make sure to always update to the latest version for stable operations.
    - If a macro file does not have a Unicode signature (BOM), it will now be opened as UTF-8 instead of using the legacy system default encoding. It is recommended to save macros as either UTF-16 (with BOM) or UTF-8 (with BOM).
    - Fixed an issue in EmEditor Free where some options in the Customize Start Window dialog could not be saved.
    - Fixed customer reported issues (1, 2, 3, 4).
    If you use the Desktop Installer version, you can select Check for Updates on the Help to download the newest version. If this method fails, please download the newest version, and run the downloaded installer. If you use the Desktop portable version, you can go to the Download page to download the newest version. The Store App versions can be updated through Microsoft Store (64-bit or 32-bit) after a few days.
