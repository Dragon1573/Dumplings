    Today, we are releasing EmEditor v24.4.2.
    v24.4.2 includes the following bug fixes. Please make sure to always update to the latest version for stable operations.
    - Enhanced the Undo speed after performing a “Replace All” action, even when newlines are involved.
    - Made adjustments for the “Yu Gothic” font.
    - Fixed an issue with the Filter toolbar where the “Abort Filter” during incremental search did not scroll to the selected item.
    - Fixed a potential crash related to DirectWrite.
    - Addressed a potential crash during printing.
    - Resolved a recurring crash when loading a workspace.
    - Fixed a potential crash when clicking the “Find Next” button on the Find toolbar, especially when the “Search All Documents in Group” option is enabled and a window is split.
    - Fixed a bug where encountering a macro error would cause the cursor to jump to the wrong line in v24.4.x.
    - Fixed a bug present since v22.4 where EmEditor could read duplicate lines when opening very large files on a slower hard drive with disk caching enabled.
    - Fixed an issue where replacing with “\J” caused an error.
    - Fixed an issue where the file size wasn’t displayed immediately after opening a file.
    - Set a maximum limit of 10,000,000 to the Additional Lines to Search for Regular Expressions text box in the Advanced dialog box.
