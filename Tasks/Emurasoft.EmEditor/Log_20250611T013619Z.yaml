    Today, we are releasing EmEditor v25.1.4.
    v25.1.4 includes the following bug fixes. Please make sure to always update to the latest version for stable operations.
    - In version 25.1.3, macro files without a Unicode signature (BOM) were opened as UTF-8 instead of using the traditional system default encoding. In this version, weâ€™ve reverted this change, so such files are now opened with the system default encoding as before. However, if the file contains characters that cannot be converted using the system default encoding, an error message will be displayed. We recommend saving macros as either UTF-16 (with BOM) or UTF-8 (with BOM).
    - Fixed an issue where column headers could sometimes disappear when scrolling through CSV files.
    - Added support for touchpad scrolling.
    - Fixed an issue in EmEditor Free where recent files and fonts were not being displayed.
