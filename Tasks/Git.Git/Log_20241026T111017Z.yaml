    Bug Fixes
    - A regression in v2.47.0 where git maintenance start crashed immediately was fixed.
    - A regression where clones, fetches and pushes via SSH would dead-lock was fixed.
    - As of Git for Windows v2.47.0, Scalar was supposed to enable an optimized push algorithm, but for a typo didn't, which was fixed.
    - A few documentation and other, minor bug fixes from upstream Git were integrated into Git for Windows early.
