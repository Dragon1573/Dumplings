    - Comes with Git LFS v3.6.1, addressing CVE-2024-53263.
    Bug Fixes
    - CVE-2024-50338: Git Credential Manager can be tricked to exfiltrate credentials for a trusted site to an untrusted site. Since the URLs needed for such an attack look suspicious, this usually requires a recursive clone or fetch.
    - CVE-2024-53263: In conjunction with CVE-2024-52006, Git LFS can be tricked to exfiltrate credentials for a trusted site to an untrusted site.
    - CVE-2024-50349: When prompting the user for a password in the terminal, Git does not neutralize control characters.
    - CVE-2024-52005: The sideband channel does not neutralize control characters.
    - CVE-2024-52006: Similar to CVE-2020-5260, affecting credential helpers that interpret Carriage Returns as newlines.
