    - Comes with cURL v8.11.0.
    - Comes with Git LFS v3.6.0.
    Bug Fixes
    - Due to a bug introduced in the v2.47 cycle, the installer showed an empty "experimental options" page, which was fixed.
    - A potential crash in Git Bash on Insider versions of Windows/ARM64 was fixed.
    - On Windows/ARM64, running the 64-bit version of Git for Windows could infrequently cause deadlocked threads (see e.g. this report or this one), which was addressed.
