    1. Adjusted the behavior of the close button to directly exit the program (reverting the previous change).
    2. Fixed the issue where some models installed via ollama pull could not be recognized, such as the latest version.
    3. Resolved the issue where the model list could only be retrieved after restarting the process when the Ollama service was stopped.
    4. Adjusted the automatic setting of the environment variable OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1 for Ollama installations via AingDesk to prevent potential malicious exploitation.
