    Streamlined Interfaces Easily identify key information with streamlined expandable rows in the refreshed Enzymes view which provides enhanced filtering options and more intuitive scrolling. Controls in the Secondary Structure view now float above the content and the structure list and statistics have been modernized.

    Live search results update when files are added, renamed, modified or deleted, while improved selection behavior, filtering, and sorting options allow you to more easily identify and modify files.

    Adding a Touch of Color
    A number of new coloring options allow you to visualize residues and their associated chemical and transmembrane properties, locate buttons in the side toolbar, and switch between light and dark modes.

    Navigation and Data Management
    Efficiently navigate, annotate and manage your plasmids via the streamlined files and folders panel, which now enables viewing and performing bulk annotation and file transformations on all open sequence files. Focus on Region to zoom into larger sequences.
