    New features
    - E-book viewer: Support for jumping to and displaying paper edition page numbers
      If an e-book contains embedded information about the pages from the paper edition of the book, the calibre E-book viewer can now jump to a page number via the Go to button in the viewer controls. You can also optionally have the current paper edition page number displayed in the header/footer by adding "Pages from paper edition" to either the header or footer in the viewer settings.
    - Edit book: When text is selected allow changing the indentation of all lines in the selection by pressing Tab to increase one level or Shift+Tab to decrease one level

    - Allow a plugboard to change the series_index as well as the series name.
    - News download: News recipes can now optionally use browser engines based on either Qt or Chromium network stacks instead of mechanize
    - Email delivery: When sending emails to Kindles do not convert filenames to English letters as Amazon appears to have finally fixed their email servers to handle non-English filenames
    - Quickview: Add a tooltip displaying the full cell contents
