    Agent To-dos
    Agents now plan ahead with structured to-do lists, making long-horizon tasks easier to understand and track.
    The agent breaks down longer tasks with dependencies, visible to you in chat and streamed into Slack when relevant. It can update this list as work progresses, keeping context fresh and interactions predictable.
    To-dos are also visible in Slack if integration is setup!

    Queued messages
    You can now queue follow-up messages for Agent once it's done with current task. Just type your instructions and send. Once in queue, you can reorder tasks and start executing without waiting.

    Memories (now GA)
    Memories is now GA. Since 1.0, we've improved memory generation quality, added in-editor UI polish, and introduced user approvals for background-generated memories to preserve trust.

    PR indexing & search
    Cursor now indexes and summarizes PRs much like it does files. You can search old PRs semantically or explicitly fetch a PR, issue, commit, or branch into context.
    This includes associated GitHub comments, BugBot reviews, and Slack agent supportâ€”making postmortem analysis or incident tracing much faster.

    Improved embeddings for semantic search
    Codebase search is now much more accurate with our new embedding model. We've also re-tuned prompts to yield cleaner, more focused results.

    Faster Tab
    Tab completions are now ~100ms faster, and TTFT has been reduced by 30%. We made this possible by restructuring our memory management system and optimizing data transfer pathways.

    Let Agent resolve merge conflicts
    When merge conflicts occur, Agent can now attempt to resolve them for you. Click Resolve in Chat and relevant context will be added to resolve the conflict.
