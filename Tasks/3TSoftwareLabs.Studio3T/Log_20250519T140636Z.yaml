    Improvement: Aggregation and Intellishell - The merge stage no longer returns a result, this makes it consistent with the MongoDB shell behaviour.
    Fix: Collection Tab - Now respects collation options when counting the number of documents in a collection.
    Fix: Import - Fixed a crash that would occur when trying to open an Import without any selection in the connection tree.
    Fix: Update Notification - The notification is no longer disabled with a NPS Survery notification is also open.
