    Broad URI match detection suggestions
    The app checks for URIs that refer to the same domain. If you have one item with a URI that has Host match detection and a second one with Domain match detection:
    service1.example.com Host match detection
    service2.example.com Domain match detection
    then it's highly likely that the second URI should also be narrowed down to a Host match detection.
