    - Fixed a bug where calibration was being applied at the highest sample rate of the document instead of the sample rate of the glucose channel.
    - Glucose Calibration data is not recoverable from in the event of a LabChart crash.
    Known Issues
    - Event markers for calibration points may not appear sometimes and at all in the first sampling record. Refresh the chart view or reload the document to ensure the data and event markers are drawn correctly.
    - Using a temperature channel with Out Of Range data values may caused unexpected results when used as the temperature compensation source channel for a glucose calibration.
