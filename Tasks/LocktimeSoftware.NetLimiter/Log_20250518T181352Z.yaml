    This release brings two major improvements. Since now NetLimiter allows import from other Stats databases (version 5) and broadens functionality of DNS-based rules.

    New features
    - Imports from NetLimiter version 5 databases are now possible. This tool is accessible from the Stats Manager.
    - NetLimiter now supports filtering domains that are not automatically detected by the application. Simply create a filter for a domain and add rules to control its traffic.
    Fixed bugs
    - Stats data management now even more robust.
    - Several minor internal fixes.
ReleaseTime: 2025-05-17
