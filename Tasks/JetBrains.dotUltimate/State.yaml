    ReSharper 2023.3.2 bug-fix update
    Here are some of the fixes included in this build:
    - We've resolved several erroneous behaviors involving solution-wide analysis. SWEA no longer causes IDE freezes (RSRP-495167), and inaccurate warnings don't appear for Razor files (RSRP-493921).
    - The Hides primary constructor parameter warning now only applies to captured primary constructor parameters (RSRP-495077).
    - Primary constructor refactorings now work correctly (RSRP-494901, RSRP-494860).
    - Clicking on the DataTip icon for record type variables during debugging now results in ReSharper displaying all relevant properties and methods (RSRP-494989).
    - We've eliminated the bug where moving a file template to the In Quicklist section would cause an infinite loop of duplicate copies to appear (RSRP-495232).
    - Several bugs causing false positive Entity Framework inspection warnings have been resolved (RSRP-495186, RSRP-495237, RSRP-495227, RSRP-494858).
