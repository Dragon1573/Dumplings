    ReSharper 2024.1.3 update
    New inspection for unawaited calls to PartialAsync in Razor
    When developing Razor views, it is common to overlook async method calls that require the await keyword. While your code might still compile, forgetting the await keyword means ASP.NET will not execute the view and will not write the intended HTML to the response. ReSharper will now warn you when a PartialAsync call is missing an await, helping you side-step the frustrating issue of broken view rendering.
