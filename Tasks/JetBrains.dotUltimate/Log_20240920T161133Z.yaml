    ReSharper 2024.2.5 Has Been Released!
    ReSharper
    - If you experienced a hang of Visual Studio on startup when ReSharper AI was installed, it is likely that the problem will go away after installing this build.
    - A suppression by comment for the Possible multiple enumeration inspection works again (RSRP-498212).
    dotMemory
    This release brings a new feature to improve your user experience â€“ Automatic View Selection. If you open an object set that results in a single element (e.g., a number of String objects), dotMemory automatically switches to a more relevant view. Let's look at an example when you open a set of strings:
    - Before: dotMemory opens the String object set in the Types view, displaying only a single String item, which requires manually switching to a different view for further analysis.
    - Now: dotMemory automatically opens the set in the Similar Retention view, and the Types view is disabled.
    Dynamic Program Analysis
    - The Monitoring window in Rider no longer prevents you from starting debugging with the Support for C++ Language plugin disabled (DPA-2258).
    - We brought back showing custom metrics in the Monitoring window (DPA-2284).
    dotTrace
    - The dotTrace command line tool no longer fails to attach to a single-file .NET application on Linux arm64 (DTRC-31181).
