    Today we're releasing Krita 5.2.10! This is a bug fix release. After this release we will focus on releasing Krita 5.3.0, the next feature release, and Krita 6.0.0, the first release based on Qt6.
    [!NOTE] Note for users of keyboards with more than 12 function keys. Programs like WeChat regularly inject a spurious F22 keypress to get focus. From 5.2.10, Krita will by default ignore any function key higher than F12. If you have a keyboard or other device sending such keypresses, you can enable them by adding the following line to your kritarc file: ... ignoreHighFunctionKeys=false ...
