    Restoring Magnification After Upgrading to Windows 11 24H2
    After upgrading to Windows 11 version 24H2, some users found that they no longer had magnification after starting ZoomText 2024. This update solves the problem for most users. If you still have this issue after updating ZoomText, refer to TSN 1802 for information on restoring magnification.
    Other Improvements
    - In AppReader's App View, the UP and DOWN Arrow keys no longer navigated to the previous and next paragraphs in Word 365 and other apps. This update resolves the issue.
    - All ZoomText .NET 6 components have been updated to .NET 8.
