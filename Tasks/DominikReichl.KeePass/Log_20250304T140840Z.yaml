    New Features:
    - When no entry is selected in the entry list of the main window, the details view now displays information of the current group (name, expiry time, tags, notes).
    - Added option 'Unhide empty data' (in 'Tools' → 'Options' → tab 'Advanced', turned off by default).
    - On the 'Preview'/'Generate' tab page of the password generator dialog, the average estimated quality of the generated passwords is now displayed.
    - Added Ctrl+H keyboard shortcut for the 'Show/hide password using asterisks' option in report dialogs.
    - Added 'User-Agent' header for HTTP/HTTPS/WebDAV web requests.
    - If Microsoft Edge has been uninstalled, it now no longer appears in the 'URL(s)' menu.
    - Added 'More Commands' item in the group and entry context menus (it shows the corresponding full menu).
    - Added 'Status' column in the triggers dialog.
    - Added support for comments in INI files.
    - Enhanced CodeWallet TXT import module.
    - Fatal error messages are now more detailed when running KeePass with the '-debug' command line option.
    - Added filter for duplicate MRU items (caused by an MRU item with an unsuitable database file path in an enforced configuration file).
    - Added filter for duplicate key source associations (caused by a key source association with an unsuitable database file path in an enforced configuration file).
    - Added solution and project files for Visual Studio 2022.
    - Added workaround for Mono's tree view right-click and context menu handling.
    Improvements:
    - When clicking on a group in the group tree of the main window, all entries are deselected now.
    - If the currently selected entry does not have parameters for generating time-based one-time passwords, the Ctrl+T and Ctrl+Shift+T keyboard shortcuts are now ignored.
    - Improved icon handling in certain entry lists (significantly faster creation of such a list when there are many entries with custom icons, reduced memory usage, reduced number of GDI objects, ...).
    - In the master key prompt dialog, toggling the hiding of the password now does not change the state of the password check box anymore.
    - When generating passwords for the 'Preview'/'Generate' tab page of the password generator dialog takes too long, it is now aborted.
    - Replaced status indicators on the 'Preview'/'Generate' tab page of the password generator dialog.
    - Increased the number of preview passwords to 50.
    - UI improvements in the trigger editing dialog.
    - After showing a command/placeholder confirmation dialog (cmd:// URI, {CMD:...} placeholder, {REF:P@...} placeholder), KeePass now focuses the previously focused window.
    - Renamed 'entry view' to 'details view' (because it can now also display details of a group).
    - Removed the group/entry duplication commands from the context menus (they continue to be available in the main menu).
    - Various improvements in some import modules.
    - Improved UUID zero tests.
    - The revision component of the assembly version is now invariant.
    - Improved PLGX cache item identifiers.
    - Improved project cleanup script.
    - Upgraded installer.
    - Various code optimizations.
    - Minor other improvements.
    Bugfixes:
    - Fixed two image list handling bugs.
