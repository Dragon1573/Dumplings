    New Features:
    - Added option 'Prevent certain screen captures' (in 'Tools' → 'Options' → tab 'Security', turned off by default); note that this may also prevent legitimate other software (remote desktop solutions, accessibility tools such as screen magnifiers, etc.) from seeing KeePass windows.
    - Added the new option 'Prevent certain screen captures' in the 'Enforce Options (All Users)' dialog (in 'Tools' → 'Advanced Tools' → 'Enforce Options').
    - Key files can be created on the secure desktop now.
    - Added shortcut keys for the 'Copy Group (Encrypted)' (Ctrl+Shift+C) and 'Paste Group' (Ctrl+Shift+V) commands.
    - Ctrl+Shift+V can now be used for pasting entries while the group tree has the input focus and vice versa.
    - Added 'More' button in the icon picker dialog, which shows a menu that provides two commands: 'Rename' and 'Export'; the menu is also shown as context menu of the custom icons list.
    - When importing an icon, the file name without extension is now used as icon name.
    - Added option 'Remember password hiding setting' in the main window column configuration dialog (turned off by default).
    - Added support for long paths when running on .NET 4.6.2 or higher.
    - Some error messages now contain the type and the HResult of the exception that occured.
    - Some error messages are now more detailed when running KeePass with the '-debug' command line option.
    - Bitwarden JSON import: two-digit years are now converted to four-digit years.
    - Added UIFlags bit for automatically adjusting weak key transformation settings to the current default values (without a confirmation dialog).
    - Added DPI detection on Unix-like systems.
    - For applications using KeePass as a library: added a new common initialization method ('CommonInitialize') that allows a custom error handling/reporting.
    Improvements:
    - Databases are now always saved in the KDBX 4/4.1 file format; if you need a KDBX 3.1 file (e.g. for compatibility with an old app), perform an export: main menu 'File' → 'Export' → format 'KeePass KDBX (2.34, Old Format)'.
    - Auto-Type: improved compatibility with Remote Desktop Client (WSL).
    - In an auto-type error dialog, the sequence is now only displayed if KeePass has been started with the '-debug' command line option.
    - Increased maximum length of the main window title.
    - Improved handling of shortcut keys in the main window.
    - Improved entry data exchange menu update performance.
    - After moving a group, KeePass now ensures that the group is visible.
    - Improved database save confirmation dialog text.
    - When showing the master key creation/change dialog on the secure desktop, trying to perform an operation that is not supported on the secure desktop now results in a simple error message, i.e. it is not possible anymore to choose to cancel the dialog and perform the operation on the normal desktop; this avoids certain accidental data loss scenarios.
    - Various improvements in the simple file browser dialog (for the secure desktop).
    - While a hot key control of the options dialog is focused, dialog-specific keyboard shortcuts are now disabled.
    - Changed the 'MAC Address' password generator profile such that it always generates a unicast, locally administered MAC address in the SLAP administratively assigned quadrant.
    - In the icon picker dialog: moved the 'Export' command into the 'More'/context menu of the custom icons list.
    - When running on .NET 4.7 or higher, KeePass now supports all TLS/SSL protocol versions that are supported/enabled by the framework/system.
    - Improved error messages for exception chains.
    - Improved serialization, deserialization and conversion of nullable booleans.
    - Improved deserialization of variant dictionaries.
    - Improved application context initialization.
    - Improved termination of the program in case of a fatal exception.
    - Various UI text improvements.
    - Various code optimizations.
    - Minor other improvements.
    Bugfixes:
    - (None).
