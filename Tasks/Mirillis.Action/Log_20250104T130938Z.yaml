    - Added new capture mode (Variable Refresh Rate) which allows intelligent video capture synchronized with display's v-sync, minimizing recorded file size and lowering power consumption and CPU/GPU use (please note that in this mode the video framerate is the maximum framerate at which the video will be captured - from 1fps to the value selected).
    - Fixed 4:4:4 DirectX 9 (and older DirectX) recording (please note that DirectX 9 is recorded in 4:2:2 format and stored in 4:4:4).
    - Fixed problems with region recording/streaming in multi-display setups.
    - Movement of selected region is now possible during recording/streaming.
    - Added "Show welcome screen" option that allows omitting Action! welcome screen (Settings->General last option on the list).
    - Added support for video capture from any video streaming service using Google Chrome browser (enter Action! Game Mode and start video using Chrome browser).
    - Stability improvements.
    Please note that currently Facebook integration is not working (direct streaming to your Facebook wall using Facebook API and account manager). Streaming to Facebook is still possible using URL/Streamkey method. After trying to log in to your Facebook account you will see a message that Mirillis Streamer App is not working. We are working on a new app that should be ready this month. Please forgive us for this inconvenience.
