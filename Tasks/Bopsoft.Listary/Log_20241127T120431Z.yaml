    Main Updates‚Äã
    - New: refactored custom indexing to provide a more stable and superior user experience:
      - New: You can now search while creating or updating a custom index.

    - New: Non-Pro users can now also create custom indexes.

    - New: View the indexing status at any time (including the number of files and the last update time).
    - New: Index updates now use incremental updates, making the process faster.
    - New: Support for manually updating custom indexes.

    Other Updates‚Äã
