    Improved support for folding blocks
    - Fixed an issue where some types of blocks could not be folded.
    - The fold state is now stored in the buffer file so that it's persisted between sessions.
    - Added three new commands for folding and unfolding blocks:
      - foldBlock - Folds the current/selected block(s). Default key binding is Ctrl-Alt-[ on Windows/Linux and Cmd-Option-[ on Mac.
      - unfoldBlock - Unfolds the current/selected block(s). Default key binding is Ctrl-Alt-] on Windows/Linux and Cmd-Option-] on Mac.
      - toggleFoldBlock - Toggles the fold state of the current/selected block. Default key binding is Ctrl-Alt-. on Windows/Linux and Cmd-Option-. on Mac.
    - Folded blocks now display the first 50 characters of the block content, as well as the number of lines in the block.
    - Default key bindings for folding code on Mac changed from Cmd-Option-[ and Cmd-Option-] to Cmd-Shift-[ and Cmd-Shift-] (to avoid conflicts with the new block folding commands)
    Other features and fixes

    - Fix wrong positioning if IME interface (for Chinese input)
