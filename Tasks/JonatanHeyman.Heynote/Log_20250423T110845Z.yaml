    New Features
    - Added support for custom key bindings. See the documentation for more info.

    - Added functionality for moving blocks up and down. Default key bindings are Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+Shift+Up and Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+Shift+Down.
    - Added functionality for inserting the current date and time. Default key binding is Alt+Shift+D.
