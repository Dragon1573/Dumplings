    C-LEVEL FACILITIES
    - The S-compatibility macros F77_COM and F77_COMDECL defined in header ‘R_ext/RS.h’ are deprecated and will be removed shortly. We could find no record of their use.
    BUG FIXES
    - Mathlib function lgammacor(x) no longer warns about underflow to zero for large x.
    - Text widths and heights were incorrectly reported by the Quartz device if the drawing context didn't exist yet (typically when drawing off-screen to a window that is yet to appear, see PR#18591).
    - The Quartz device could segfault in cases where paths with spaces are used in the new glyph drawing API. Thanks to Tomek Gieorgijewski (PR#18758).
    - On macOS in R CRAN builds, it is again possible to read little-endian UTF-16 text with a BOM from a connection using encoding="UTF-16". Users building R from source should avoid using the system libiconv in macOS 14.1 and later.
    - methods' internal .requirePackage() now re-enables primitive method dispatch when needed; thanks to Ivan Krylov for demystifying CRAN package check failures on the R-devel mailing list.
