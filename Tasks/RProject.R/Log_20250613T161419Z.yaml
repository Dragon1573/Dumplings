    NEW FEATURES
    - The internal method of unzip() now follows unzip 6.00 in how it handles extracted file paths which contain "../". With thanks to Ivan Krylov.
    INSTALLATION
    - Standalone nmath can be built with early-2025 versions of clang-based compilers such as LLVM clang 20, Apple clang 17 and Intel icx 2025.0.
    - Tcl/Tk 9 can be used to build package tcltk: this has become the default in some Linux distributions. N.B. several third-party packages currently require Tcl/Tk 8 or even 8.6 without declaring so.
    BUG FIXES
    - Java detection in javareconf could not detect ‘libjvm.*’ in the zero variant of the JDK (PR#18884). All valid variants as of JDK 24u are now supported.
    - factanal(.., rotation=*) now correctly updates rotmat, fixing PR#18886.
    - dnbinom(<large>, <muchlarger>, ..) now is 0 correctly, instead of NaN or Inf sometimes.
    - dbinom(<large>, n=Inf, ..) is 0 now correctly, instead of NaN which also fixes many dnbinom() cases, notably those mentioned in PR#16727 comment #5.
    - Fixing C level “binomial deviance” bd0() for extreme arguments (preventing under-/overflow) solves more PR#16727 cases and also prevents some full accuracy loss in such cases for dbinom(), dnbinom(), and via dbinom_raw() potentially dgeom(), dhyper(), dbeta(), and df().
    - signif(1.**e308, digits) no longer truncates unnecessarily (but still to prevent overflow to Inf), fixing PR#18889.
    - prettyNum(*, zero.print={>=1-char}, replace.zero=TRUE) now works as documented, thanks to Marttila Mikko and Ivan Krylov's messages on R-devel.
    - pbeta(x, a,b, ..) for very large a,b no longer returns NaN but the correct values (0 or 1, or their logs for log.p = TRUE). This improves Mathlib's C level bratio() and hence also pnbinom(), etc..
