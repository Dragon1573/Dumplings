  Key: ReleaseNotes
  Value: Technical refresh. No changes to the codecs. The viewer has been rebuilt with current tools and libraries. Windows XP and Windows Vista support has been dropped, with the new minimum system requirements set to Windows 7 SP1 plus all existing updates. Future versions may require Windows 10 at some point. 32-bit support dropped. Requires 64-bit CPU with AVX instruction set (available since Sandy Bridge - year 2011) or later. About 10% performance improvement when scanning folders to find pictures plus minor overall performance improvements throughout due to modernized toolset and libraries. The legacy 32/64-bit 1.9.360 builds from April 2017 with XP and Vista support are still available but will not be further updated.
