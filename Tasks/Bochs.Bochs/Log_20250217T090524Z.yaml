    Brief summary :
    - Include Bochs debugger support in all release binaries.
      Bochs internal debugger and Bochs GUI debugger are compiled in by default and
      there are no special Bochs binaries with internal debugger support anymore.
    - Integrated softfloat3e library replacing older softfloat2a fpu-emulation code
    - Bugfixes for CPU emulation correctness (critical bugfixes for VMX, WAITPKG, LASS,
      XSAVEC/XSAVES, CPUID and SHA1 ISA implementation)
    - Added emulation of missing AMD 3DNow! instructions
    - Implemented AVX512_FP16 Intel instruction set based on softfloat3e library
      (enabled in Xeon Sapphire Rapids CPU definition)
    - Implemented MONITORLESS MWAIT instructions support
    - Implemented initial support for AVX10_1 + AVX10_2 ISA extensions and AVX10
      CPUID leaf 0x24 (AVX10_1 first to be enabled in Xeon Granite Rapids)
    - Implemented AMX-TF32 and AMX-AVX512 ISA extensions
    - Implemented RAO-INT ISA and MSR_IMM ISA extensions
    - CPUID: Added new CPU definitions: for i386, i486DX4, AMD Athlon XP and Intel Core i5 Arrow Lake CPUs
    - CPUID: Support for enabling/disabling of one or more CPU features from CPUID
      configuration (see "add_features" and "exclude_features" in bochsrc sample and documentation)
      ! CPUID: Old bx_generic CPUID model is deprecated with all associated .bochsrc
      CPUID configuration options, use pre-defined CPU models instead
    - Several fixes and improvements for the Cirrus and Voodoo emulation
    - USB: Added the USB Debugger support for xHCI and UHCI (Windows / GTK3)
    - Added USB boot option (requires i440fx.bin BIOS)
    - LGPL'd VGABIOS updated to version 0.9c (Cirrus / VBE fixes and extensions)
    - Added i440fx.bin BIOS written by Ben Lunt (https://github.com/fysnet/i440fx)
    - Documentation updates and fixes after transition to GIT
