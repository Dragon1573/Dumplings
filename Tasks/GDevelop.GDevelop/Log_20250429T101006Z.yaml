    üßë‚Äçüè´ UI/UX essentials to know when building your game
    Keep learning with GDevelop with this new course about UI/UX essentials to make sure your game delivers the best experience to your players!
    This course was prepared by professional UI/UX designers and game developers. It goes from the very basics to advanced concepts helpful to learn:
    - how to improve your players experience,
    - how to improve player retention,
    - do testing with players,
    - improve accessibility,
    - understand color, visual hierarchy, fonts,
    - and much more.
    This is a premium course, specifically made for the GDevelop community, that is available for accounts having a premium membership. You can also unlock each chapter for 200 credits.
    ü§ñ Ask AI tab: get help when building your game
    A new AI assistant tab can be opened using the button "Ask AI", located on the top right of the GDevelop editor.
    Get instant answers, tips, and guidance while creating your game: the AI has knowledge of most features in GDevelop and will answer with accurate links to extensions, actions, conditions or behaviors you can use. It can also read your game scenes, objects and behaviors (but does not have access to events or code inside the project or extensions).
    Each AI answer costs 5 GDevelop credits. Premium members also receive a number of AI answers included every month.
    This AI is experimental and meant to help learning GDevelop. You can add a "like" or "dislike" on each answer - and tell what's wrong when an answer is not satisfactory. This will help the GDevelop team to understand how useful is the AI.
    üíù Improvements
    - 3D models previews are now shown in the editor. Those previews are visible in the Resources tab, in the 3D Model object dialog, or when swapping/selecting from a project resource.
    - Add support for variants of custom objects ("Prefabs"):
      - Variants allows to restyle custom objects. They can be customized with the graphical editor - like a scene.
      - The asset store will progressively use them notably for UI elements (buttons, sliders)
    - Allow selecting resources that are already in the project when editing an object - this is especially useful for cloud projects.
    - Add vertical alignment property, action and condition for both BitmapText and BBText objects.
    - Improve description of the condition to compare a timer value (explaining that a timer must be started/reset first).
    - Add explanatory tooltips to game analytics graphs.
    - Add a button to copy the Ask AI response
    üêõ Bug fixes
    - Fix the sentence parameter of "loading progress" condition.
    - Fix various issues with the 3D physics engine:
      - Fix the box shape to always be oriented on Z,
      - Fix memory leaks.
    - Fix anchored object position when the object and the camera is moved.
    - Fix Piskel crashes with black screens when doing multiple undos.
    - Fix layout issues when filling action/conditions parameters.
