    üíù Improvements
    - Add "Quick Customization" in the Get Started page: choose a starter game and quickly replace objects and tweak their behaviors. The game is then automatically published so it can be shared: this is perfect for new users to get a taste of how a game works and make their own remix of a game before going further.

    - Add an option in objects context menu to quickly swap assets of Sprites and 3D models, using the asset store:
      - This is perfect for quickly prototyping or trying new game art,
      - Animation of the object that are missing in the asset are replaced by a copy of the 1st asset animation. 3D model volume is adjusted to stay the same while keeping asset proportions.
    - Allow hot-reloading of 3D models (Thanks @arthuro555!)
    - Display the number of tilemap objects available in premium asset packs before purchase.
    - Allow drag and drop in the extension function parameter editor
    üêõ Bug fixes
    - Fix having to select another function to reopen the same function on mobile in the extension editor
    - Fix extension's behavior and object properties lists not scrolling on mobile
    ‚öôÔ∏è Extensions
    Reviewed
    - [Physics car] New behavior that simulate a top down car motion (using the Physics Engine behavior)
    - [3rd person camera] Fix the offset to rotate with the camera - it allows to keep the player near the bottom of the screen or a bit on the side like in some 3rd person shooters.
    üé® Assets
    - [City Tileset] Update: Add Tilemap object with the whole tileset
    üïπ Examples
    - [Arrow Fight] Update to allow mid-game join
    - [3D car coin hunt] Use the new behavior for the car movement
    - [3D car coin hunt] Make the controls independent from the car size
    - [3D lane runner] Use custom extensions to organize events
    üïπ Premium Game Templates
    - Update Cubic World game template by Jurfix:
      - The method of saving for world information has been changed for heavy objects (air and cubes), this is due to the browser limitation on the amount of information saved in Local Storage (5 MB), this problem was solved by creating a new saving extension that uses IndexedDB, now you can save an almost unlimited amount of data.
      - For Apple mobile devices, Long Tap is now disabled, which prevented the destruction of cubes. (You can see how this is implemented in the Mobile Control Helper extension)
      - Bug fixes:
        - Now cubes cannot be placed inside the player, which led to getting stuck or falling out of the world.
        - The buttons in the menu and pause are no longer distorted when turning the screen on mobile devices.
    - Add a new premium game template: Card Game by VegeTato
    üõ† Internal changes (for developers)
    - Replace electron-is with electron-is-dev (Thanks @arthuro555!)
    - Allow custom objects and behaviors to use resources from properties
    - Fix GDevelop project files so they are versioned with the same version as the editor (Thanks @f0nar!)
    - Avoid to use an intermediate ThreeGroup for custom objects in the editor
      - 2D custom objects displayed in the editor now also use the origin point of their 1st child unless an hidden property force a location.
