    ‚ú® Instance properties panel rework
    The instance properties panel of the scene editor has been reworked into a more compact and user-friendly panel. Read the documentation about this panel to learn everything that it offers.

    üíæ Autosave for Cloud projects
    A new autosave feature is automatically enabled for Cloud projects:
    - Cloud projects are now autosaved on each game preview. Should the editor crash, it will help recover your project.
    - The saved project is stored on the device for performance reasons.
    Warning
    If you're using GDevelop online on a public computer, this feature saves a copy of your project in the browser storage. To make sure no one can access it, make sure to log out the editor when you leave the computer.
