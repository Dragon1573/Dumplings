    🚗 New 3D physics-based vehicle behavior
    You can now simulate realistic vehicules using the new 3D car behavior, powered by the 3D physics engine.

    - Advanced details can be customized: from wheel setup and gear ratios to engine torque, steering, brakes, anti-roll bars, and drivetrain (front/rear).
    - The default setup offers a semi-realistic, arcade-style driving feel. For smoother gameplay, explore the example projects to see how fine-tuning makes a big difference.

    💝 Improvements
    - The Play section (as well as gd.games) has been refined with more emphasis on featured games, new games and games in development.
    - Jolt physics engine was upgraded to version 0.35.0.
    🐛 Bug fixes
    - Incomplete/broken installation prevention: some users suffered from faulty updates, for instance when the computer is shut down during an update. This was causing the app to be incomplete and projects to become corrupted after a save (ex: BBText objects being broken). GDevelop will now warn and prevent usage of the app if a broken installation is detected.
    - Fix crash when selecting a resource after switching tabs in the Resource selection dialog.
    - Fix grid snapping of pasted instances.
    ⚙️ Extensions
    - Update wording in CrazyGames SDK
    🎨 Assets
    - Add a new free pack: 3D Scene Essentials by @Eldarduil
