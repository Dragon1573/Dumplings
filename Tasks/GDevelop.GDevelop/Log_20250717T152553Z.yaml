    📚 A streamlined Learn page with new premium courses to learn gamedev
    GDevelop homepage shows a new, updated Learn page when you launch GDevelop:

    It serves as a home, notably for new users, highlighting the different resources you can use to improve your game creation skills:
    - 📕 Premium, complete courses designed specifically for GDevelop: learn the GDevelop essentials (accessible for free by all subscribers), how to make a specific game or specialized courses about marketing, UI, etc... Stay tuned for new content in the following weeks: sound design, how to make art for your game, and a course about making a 3D GTA-like 👀
    - ⛳️ In-app tutorials (previously found in the Get Started page),
    - 🎥 All the video tutorials from the Youtube Channel
    - 👾 Links to great examples to use as a starting point
    - 📚 More free tutorials (video or text based), as well as the traditional links to the Discord, the forum and to ask a question to the GDevelop AI.
    The courses are exclusive content made by content creators, teachers or GDevelop specialists. They are separate from GDevelop subscriptions. All courses can be purchased with credits, using Paypal or credit cards (Stripe).
    🌟 All premium courses are free one more day for everyone with a Silver, Gold, or Pro subscription.
    The full GDevelop Master Course, featuring 15 chapters, dozens of tasks, and step-by-step answers, will remain permanently accessible to all subscribers. Thank you for your support!
