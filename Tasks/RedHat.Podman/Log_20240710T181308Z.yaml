    Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug that would sometimes prevent the mount of some podman machine volumes into the virtual machine when using the Apple hypervisor (#22569).
    - Fixed a bug where podman top would show the incorrect UID for processes in containers run in a user namespace (#22293).
    - Fixed a bug where the /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf files in a container would be empty after restoring from a checkpoint (#22901).
    - Fixed a bug where the --pod-id-file argument to podman run and podman create did not respect the pod's user namespace (#22931).
    - Fixed a bug in the Podman remote client where specifying a invalid connection in the CONTAINER_CONNECTION environment variable would lead to a panic.
    Misc
    - Virtual machines run by podman machine using the Apple hypervisor now wait 90 seconds before forcibly stopping the VM, matching the standard systemd shutdown timeout (#22515).
    - Updates the containers/image library to v5.31.1
