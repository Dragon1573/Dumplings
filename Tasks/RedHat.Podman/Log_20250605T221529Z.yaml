    Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where containers mounting a volume to / could overmount important directories such as /proc causing start and/or runtime failures due to an issue with mount ordering (#26161).
    - Fixed a bug where Quadlet .pod units could fail to start due to their storage not being mounted (#26190).
    - Fixed a bug where containers joined to a network with DNS enabled would not include the host's search domains in their resolv.conf (#24713).
    - Fixed a bug where the --dns-opt option to podman create, podman run, and podman pod create would append options to the container's resolv.conf, instead of replacing them (#22399).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman kube play command would add an empty network alias for containers created with no name specified, causing Netavark to emit extraneous warnings.
    - Fixed a bug where the podman system df command would panic when one or more containers were created using a root filesystem (the --rootfs option to podman create and podman run) instead of from an image (#26224).
    - Fixed a bug where the log_tag field in containers.conf would override the --log-opt tag=value option to podman create and podman run (#26236).
    - Fixed a bug where the podman volume rm and podman volume inspect commands would incorrectly handle volume names containing the _ character when the SQLite database backend was in use (#26168).
    - Fixed a bug where the Podman remote client on Windows was unable to mount local folders into containers using overlay mounts (-v source:destination:O) (#25988).
    API
    - Fixed a bug in the Libpod Create API for Containers where rlimits specified with a value of -1 were causing errors, instead of being interpreted as the maximum possible value (#24886).
    - Fixed a bug in the Compat Create API for Containers where specifying an entrypoint of [] (an empty array) was ignored, instead of setting an empty entrypoint (#26078).
