    Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where rootless containers using the Pasta network driver did not properly handle localhost DNS resolvers on the host leading to DNS resolution issues (#22044).
    - Fixed a bug where Podman would warn that cgroups v1 systems were no longer supported on FreeBSD hosts.
    - Fixed a bug where HyperV podman machine VMs required an SSH client be installed on the system (#22075).
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the remote Podman client's podman build command from working properly when connecting from a rootless client to a rootful server (#22109).
    Misc
    - The HyperV driver to podman machine now fails immediately if admin privileges are not available (previously, it would only fail when it reached operations that required admin privileges).
