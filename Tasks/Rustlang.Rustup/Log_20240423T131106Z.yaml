    This new Rustup release involves some minor bug fixes.
    The headlines for this release are:
    1. Prebuilt Rustup binaries should be working on older macOS versions again.
    2. rustup-init will no longer fail when fish is installed but ~/.config/fish/conf.d hasn't been created.
    3. Regressions regarding symlinked RUSTUP_HOME/(toolchains|downloads|tmp) have been addressed.
    Since the release of 1.27.0, the project has welcomed a total of 7 new contributors. Many thanks for your hard work, and we hope to see you again!
