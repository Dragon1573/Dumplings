    This new release of rustup has been a long time in the making and comes with substantial changes.
    The following improvements might require changes to how you use rustup:
    - rustup will no longer automatically install the active toolchain if it is not installed. pr#3985
      - To ensure its installation, run rustup toolchain install with no arguments.
      - The following command installs the active toolchain both before and after this change:
        rustup show active-toolchain || rustup toolchain install
        # Or, on older versions of PowerShell:
        rustup show active-toolchain; if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { rustup toolchain install }
    - Installing a host-incompatible toolchain via rustup toolchain install or rustup default will now be rejected unless you explicitly add the --force-non-host flag. pr#4028
    rustup now officially supports the following host platforms:
    - aarch64-pc-windows-msvc pr#3840
    - loongarch64-unknown-linux-musl pr#3921
    This release also comes with various quality-of-life improvements, to name a few:
    - rustup show's output format has been cleaned up, making it easier to find out about your toolchains' status. pr#3225
    - rustup doc now accepts a flag and a topic at the same time, enabling quick navigation to specific parts of more books. pr#4070
    - rustup's remove subcommands now support more aliases such as rm and del. pr#4093
    - Basic support for nushell has been added. pr#4078
    We have additionally made the following internal changes:
    - The default download backend has been changed from reqwest with native-tls to reqwest with rustls. pr#3798
      - RUSTUP_USE_CURL and RUSTUP_USE_RUSTLS can still be used to change the download backend if the new backend causes issues. If issues do happen, please let us know.
      - The default backend now uses rustls-platform-verifier to verify server certificates, taking advantage of the platform's certificate store on platforms that support it. pr#3903
    - When creating proxy links, rustup will now try symlinks first and fall back to hardlinks, as opposed to trying hardlinks first. pr#4023
    - A new RUSTUP_LOG environment variable can be used to control tracing-based logging in rustup binaries. See the dev guide for more details. pr#3875
    Furthermore, Chris Denton joined the team. Chris has a lot of experience contributing to Windows-related parts of the Rust Project, expertise which was sorely lacking in existing team members, so we're happy to have him on board to help address Windows-specific issues.
