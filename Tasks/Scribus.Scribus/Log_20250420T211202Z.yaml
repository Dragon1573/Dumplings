    The Scribus Team is pleased to announce the release of version 1.6.4. This is a bugfix release with the following changes.
    Changes
    General
    - Avoid custom font encodings when embedding TTF fonts in PDFs.
    - Fixes to PDF import and export, and checkbox rendering on MS Edge.
    - Fixes for PDF/X-4 export when attempting to use ICC profile unsuitable for output.
    - Fixes some images being incorrectly imported as black when importing PDF.
    Build System
    - Addressed compilation issues when building against newer versions of poppler.
    Scripting Enhancements
    - Added new Python functions for page sizing, bounding boxes for page items, min/max word kerning and a fix to locked layer detection.
    Localisation Updates
    - Updated translation files

    Future
    Scribus 1.7.x is the new unstable series. While we will maintain Scribus 1.6.x as a stable version, most development will focus on 1.7.x and features and Qt6-based enhancements. 1.7.0.svn is developing relatively quickly with the integration of a new palette and docking system, new SVG based icons and many more features.
    We will look to update documentation in future 1.6.x releases and hope to launch a community documentation project in the future.
    We have no plans to fix issues in the 1.4.x branch of Scribus. No versions have been released for some time and the 1.6.x series is the stable series going forward. All branches are available in subversion (svn://scribus.net) as well as on our downloads links for all previously release versions. We encourage all Linux and *BSD distributions to switch their stable version to 1.6.x.
