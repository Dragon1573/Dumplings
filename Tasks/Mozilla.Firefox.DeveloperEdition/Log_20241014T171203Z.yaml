    New
    - Firefox now blocks third-party cookie access with Enhanced Tracking Protection's Strict mode.
    - WebRender hardware accelerated rendering is now enabled for most SVG Filter Primitives, improving performance of certain graphics-heavy content. Accelerated filters are feBlend, feColorMatrix, feComponentTransfer, feComposite, feDropShadow, feFlood, feGaussianBlur, feMerge and feOffset.
    Fixed
    - If we have the server time, we adjust the "expire" attribute value by adding the delta between the server and the local times. If the current time is set in the future, we consider valid cookies that are not expired for the server.
    - Fix for MFSA 2024-51 is included in Firefox Desktop and DevEdition 132.0b5 builds and newer.
    Changed
    - As a follow-up to our work to upgrade mixed content starting Firefox 127, we will now also block HTTP-favicons if they can not be received over HTTPS instead.
    - Firefox for Android now uses resizes-visual as the default value of the interactive-widget property of the viewport <meta> element. This means that when the software keyboard is shown, Firefox resizes the page's visual viewport but not its layout viewport, avoiding an expensive reflow and resulting in a more usable layout on many pages.
    - The "Copy Without Site Tracking" option is now greyed out when no known tracking parameters were found. Please report tracking parameters that aren't removed by filing a bug in Bugzilla.
    - The Firefox for Android address bar's default position has moved from the bottom of the screen to the top for new users. You can use the "Customize > Toolbar" setting to move the toolbar back to the bottom.
    Developer
    - Support for HTTP/2 Push has been removed due to compatibility issues with various sites. This feature is not currently supported by any other major browser.
    Web Platform
    - The requestVideoFrameCallback() method is now available on the HTMLVideoElement interface. This method enables developers to perform efficient operations on each video frame.
    - Added support for a post-quantum key exchange mechanism for TLS 1.3 (mlkem768x25519).
    - The getCapabilities method allows applications to gather the media capabilities supported for the live MediaStreamTrack.
    - The fetchpriority attribute enables web developers to optimize resource loading by specifying the relative priority of resources to be fetched by the browser. It accepts three values: auto (default priority), low (lower priority), high (higher priority). It can be specified on script, link, img elements, on the RequestInit parameter of the fetch() method and Link response headers. The HTML specification leaves the detailed interpretation of this attribute up to implementers. Firefox will typically use it to increase or decrease the urgency parameter of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 requests.
    Unresolved
    - Users may see unexpected changes in button and toolbar layout after receiving the update to 132.0b1. While the cause of this bug was identified and fixed in 132.0b2, the only way to get out of this broken state is to restore customizations back to default and then re-customize. Subsequent changes should then be remembered as expected. We apologize for the inconvenience caused. (Bug 1919721)
