    - Firefox now identifies all links in PDFs and turns them into hyperlinks.
    - Support HEVC playback on Linux.
    - You can now use the Firefox address bar as a calculator. Simply type in arithmetic expression and view the result in the address bar drop-down. Clicking on this result will copy it to your clipboard.
    Changed
    - Due to recent changes in MacOS Sequoia, the shortcut to complete search strings to .com addresses has been changed on MacOS from Ctrl+Enter to Cmd+Enter. The preference to disable this feature, browser.urlbar.ctrlCanonizesURLs, was not renamed, and it's valid across all the supported platforms.

    Web Platform
    - Support for the SVG discard element is now available.
    - Support for the SVG 2 path API is now available.
