    The CLion 2023.3.4 bug-fix update is here!
    Here are the highlights:
    - We've addressed the issue with Clazy inspections, and now they are shown in the Editor correctly (CPP-36752).
    - We've addressed the issue with the Settings Sync functionality, and now, instead of reporting an authorization problem, the IDE prompts you to log in with your JetBrains Account (IDEA-343073).
    - Customizing inspection severities is once again accessible in Settings/Preferences | Editor | Inspections (IDEA-341773).
