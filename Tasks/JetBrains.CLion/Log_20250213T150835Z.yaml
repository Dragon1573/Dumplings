    The CLion 2024.3.3 bug-fix update is ready to download.
    Here are some of the highlights included in it:
    - Code completion, code formatting, and some other actions now work as intended in split editor screens when using CLion Nova.
    - Opening a file in LightEdit mode no longer crashes the IDE when CLion Nova is enabled.
    - When working with Zephyr projects, you can now use the west build command options and sysbuild as your primary build system.
    Please share your feedback and report any issues to our issue tracker.
