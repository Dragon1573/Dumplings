    The CLion 2024.2.3 bug-fix update is now available.
    The highlights include:
    - Copying in the editor again works as intended when using CLion Nova and developing remotely with the thin client.
    - When enabled in the CMake settings, the Reload CMake project on editing CMakeLists.txt or other CMake configuration files option retains its state after CLion’s main Settings menu is reopened.
    - The debugger now correctly displays elements of std::list when using an ABI predating С++11.
    - If selected in the old terminal settings, the vertical cursor is retained when the Terminal tool window is reopened.
    - The editor pane can again be resized after placing the tab on the left and reloading the IDE.
    Please share your feedback and report any issues to our issue tracker.
