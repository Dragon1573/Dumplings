    CLion 2025.1.1 is now available, bringing a new free license and several important improvements.
    Here are the highlights:
    - CLion is now free for non-commercial use, making the IDE more accessible to students, hobbyists, and open-source contributors.
    - We’ve added support for a remote Docker toolchain, which allows you to work with remote containers via an SSH connection.
    - Qt renderers are now bundled and enabled by default, so you don’t have to do any extra work to configure them.
    - The Resync with Remote Hosts option now works again on macOS 15.4 and later.
    - CLion’s Zephyr West integration now supports the use of the nRF SDK with the Remote Host toolchain.
    - The environment variables in the CMake run configuration are no longer overridden by CMake preset variables after a project reload.
    - CLion now provides code insights for Yocto projects that use the Meson build system.
    - Auto-inserting paired {} brackets in CLion Nova now also works when { is already present and you press Enter.
