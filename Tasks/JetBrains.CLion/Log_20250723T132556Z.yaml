    The CLion 2025.1.4 bug-fix update includes the following major improvements:
    - The IDE now correctly displays MSBuild output when MSBuild v17.8 or later is used.
    - The problem of CLion Nova getting stuck on the Loading projectsâ€¦ status when opening a project no longer occurs.
    - Breakpoints now work properly when using the Remote GDB Server debug configuration and the bundled GDB.
    - When debugging on a CentOS 7 remote host, the CLion debugger no longer fails to execute code due to string formatting that is incompatible with the old Python version shipped with CentOS 7.
    Please share your feedback and report any issues to our issue tracker.
