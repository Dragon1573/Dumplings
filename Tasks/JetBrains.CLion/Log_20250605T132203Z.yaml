    The CLion 2025.1.2 bug-fix update is ready to download.
    Here are some of the highlights:
    - You can now debug AMD64 Docker containers running under Rosetta on your ARM Mac. CLion can now directly connect to the GDB server hosted by Rosetta. Watch this video to learn how to configure it.
    - Pasting text or code with CRLF line terminators in the CLion Nova editor no longer breaks it.
    - The Perf profiler again works as intended on WSL 2.
    - A timeout no longer occurs when starting a debug session for a program with many ELF sections.
    - The IDE now correctly configures CMake-based Qt projects that include custom Qt binaries when working on macOS.
    - CLion no longer invokes the MSVC 14.3 toolset instead of 14.4 after upgrading to Visual Studio 2022 17.11.4.
