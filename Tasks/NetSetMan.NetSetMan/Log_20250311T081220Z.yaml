    - Windows 11 build 24H2 compatibility
    - Security update:
    For security reasons, the application can now only be run without
    administrative privileges if the program file is located in the
    installation folder. If executed from any other location, a UAC prompt
    will be triggered.
    - Windows 11 24H2 Wi-Fi compatibility:
    Starting with Windows 11 build 24H2, access to the Wi-Fi API is
    secured by location privacy settings, as nearby wireless networks
    can be used to determine a deviceâ€™s location. To continue using
    WiFi-Management and AutoSwitch, desktop applications must be granted
    location access. A new information dialog now allows you to adjust
    the required settings with a single click.
