    Security fix
    This release contains a fix for a bug where auth tokens would, under the following circumstances, be logged to stdout:
    - The auth token was passed as a command line argument to Sentry CLI (via --auth-token)
    - The log level was set to info or debug
      - The default log level is warn, so users using the default log level were unaffected by this bug
    We now redact the --auth-token argument and anything else that looks like it might be an auth token when logging the arguments that the Sentry CLI was called with (see #2115 and #2118 for details).
