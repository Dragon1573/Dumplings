    Fixed the error dialog to handle letter key shortcuts even when text is focused.
    Fixed MonthCal W-n (number of month) width values to not be affected by DPI scaling.
    Fixed Click to not return an integer.
    Fixed detection of key::try { as an error.
    Fixed :B0*O:XY::Z to produce XYZ rather than XZ (suppressing Y).
    Fixed Send to leave any prior {modifier Down} in effect even if the key happens to be physically held down.
    Improved the reliability of the script taking focus when a menu popup is shown.
    Debugger Improvements
    Fixed stdout/stderr packets sent during the processing of another command to not corrupt the pending response.
    Fixed property_get -n <exception>.message and similar.
    Fixed corrupted results from property_get when a property returns a temporary object with a string, such as x.y.z where y => {z:"a"}.
    Fixed crashes when an asynchronous command is received during the processing of another command.
    Fixed exceptions not being deleted after they are suppressed via property_set.
    Fixed property_get -c 0 -d 0 to allow global variables, as already allowed by -d 1.
    Fixed property_get paging enumerated items incorrectly.
    Improved property_get to support property getters with one parameter (previously only the implicit __Item property supported this).
    Improved property_get to support properties of primitive values. The value must still be contained by a variable or returned from a property.
    Improved property_get to allow calling functions with <=1 parameter.
    Improved property_get to support float keys/parameters.
    Changed debugger to suppress exceptions during property evaluation.
    Changed debugger to ignore errors thrown by __Enum (treat as no items).
    Changed the <enum> pseudo-property to require __Enum. This prevents the object itself from being called as an enumerator.
    Small code size optimizations in the debugger.
