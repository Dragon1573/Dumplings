  Value: 'Changed Hotkey function to throw ValueError if Options contains an invalid option. Fixed InputHook to respect the +S option for Backspace when acting as undo. Fixed debugger to safely handle property deletion during enumeration. Fixed OLE clipboard content (e.g. error dialog text) being lost on exit. Fixed detection of invalid suffix on a hotkey, such as Hotkey "a pu". Fixed DllCall AStr* arg type to copy back only if address changes. Fixed #Include to correctly "close" any built-in variable it reads (no known impact on real-world scripts). Fixed WinTitles with two different ahk_id values to yield no match.'
