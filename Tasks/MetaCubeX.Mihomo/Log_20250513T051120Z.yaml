    What's Changed
    - For security reasons, the "path" parameter of /configs in the restful api has been restricted, and its directory also needs to be in SAFE_PATHS or workdir.
    - Other incompatible updates are the same as v1.19.6:
    - For security reasons, all paths appearing in the configuration file will be limited to workdir (regardless of whether they are relative or absolute). If there is a specific need, please specify additional safe paths by setting the SAFE_PATHS environment variable while ensuring safety. The syntax of this environment variable is the same as the PATH environment variable parsing rules of this operating system (i.e., semicolon-separated under Windows and colon-separated under other systems)
    - In addition, support for specifying routing-mark and interface-name for proxy-groups has been removed. Please specify the relevant parameters in proxies directly.
