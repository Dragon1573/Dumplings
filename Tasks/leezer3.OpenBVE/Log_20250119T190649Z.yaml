    This release hopefully replaces the broken v1.11.1.0 Rather than 'fixing' the error in the old animated parser, it has rather been migrated to the new format. Two additional small bugs have been squashed.
    Significant Changes:
    - Change: Move animated parser to the new CFG based format.
    - Fix: Don't crash if a zero length train is encountered.
    - Fix: Missing 'view log' string in GL menu.
