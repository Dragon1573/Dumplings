    Significant Changes:
    - New: Perform inline face squashing whilst loading in the MSTS Shape parser. This vastly increases the render speed of complex MSTS models.
    - New: Implement basic analog for MSTS material shaders. This should fix missing parts on many of these models.
    - Fix: Some MSTS bogie matricies were not recognised. (These are likely on OpenRails standard models)
    - Change: Improve train loading progress display. (KennyHui)
    - Change: TrainEditor2 will now write XML format trains. This is a work in progress, and not all properties are currently implemented.
    - Fix: Incorrect loaded EndSound for primary horn.
    - Fix: Correctly handle the case where a decimal is used when an integer is expected in new CFG block parser.
    - Fix: Assimp OBJ parser failing to handle faces with no normals.
    - Fix: Timetables could be missed by the bracket detection code in CSV route parser.
    - Fix: New CFG parser no longer accepts negative length cars.
    - Fix: GL.InvalidValue could be generated in debug mode.
