    Rider 2024.1.5 delivers several important fixes:
    - We resolved an issue on Linux where Rider would unexpectedly close when stopping a child process, such as a debugging session, if the main Rider process had not been started from a terminal session. [RIDER-102338]
    - Rider is able to detect the latest bundled .NET SDK in Unreal Engine solutions. [RIDER-114304]
    - Correct parsing of the dateTime and Timestamp database columns has been restored. [RIDER-114175]
    - We've addressed a bug affecting Rider's ability to correctly detect blueprint usages when working with projects built with Unreal Engine 5.4 or newer. [RIDER-112251]
    - We've also fixed a bug that prevented markdown previews from rendering images. [RIDER-111216]
    - We've resolved the issue where the terminal would open slowly when the ulimit -n value was set too high. [IJPL-103736]
    - The HTTP Client no longer sends an HTTP request with a Content-Type: text/plain header when a specific Content-Type has already been set by the user. [IJPL-65366]
    - Fixed issues with missing translations when Chinese, Korean, or Japanese localization is enabled. [IJPL-86423, IJPL-148265]
