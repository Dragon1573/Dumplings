    Rider 2023.3.4 comes with the following fixes:
    - Rider no longer has an issue with StyleCop support where incorrect handling of shared .ruleset files across multiple projects resulted in unnecessary code inspections. [RIDER-103091]
    - Proper code highlighting has been restored. [RIDER-103999]
    - Rider 2023.3 running on macOS 13.6 or older no longer causes Xamarin.Mac projects to hang, lack logs, or have issues with debugging. [RIDER-104817]
    - The correct code style is applied when pasting code copied from the AI Assistant chat. [RIDER-102425]
    - AI Assistant chat no longer has trouble finding types in F# code. [RIDER-104282]
    - The IDE is able to trigger builds when attempting to run unit tests with uncompilable code. [RIDER-104574]
    - Unit test coverage no longer fails to start due to an invalid symbol ":" in the environment variable, which previously prevented profiling initiation. [RIDER-104491]
    - We've addressed the issue with the Settings Sync functionality, and now, instead of reporting an authorization problem, the IDE prompts you to log in with your JetBrains Account. [IDEA-343073]
    - We've addressed several issues that were occurring when working with the HTTP Client. [IDEA-330341], [IDEA-334527], [IDEA-337644], [IDEA-338836], [IDEA-338958]
