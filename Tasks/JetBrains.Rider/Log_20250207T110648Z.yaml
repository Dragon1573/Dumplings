    Rider 2024.3.5 is out with the following updates:
    Notable fixes
    We've addressed an issue in the 2024.3.4 release where the Go to Class feature (Ctrl+N) did not display results as expected. This functionality has now been restored, ensuring a more reliable navigation experience in Rider. [RIDER-122277]
    New in-house models for C# cloud completion
    Cloud completion powered by AI Assistant now features new in-house models for C#. Our proprietary Jet models for C# took time to perfect, but the results are worth the wait. Youâ€™ll notice significantly improved reliability and higher-quality code suggestions, tailored to your .NET projects.
    Support for Claude Models in AI Assistant
    Anthropic's Claude models are here for JetBrains AI Assistant, provisioned in Amazon Bedrock. With this release, we're adding support for the latest Claude models, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Haiku. Check out this blog post for details.
