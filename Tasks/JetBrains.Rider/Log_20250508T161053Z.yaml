    Rider 2025.1.2 is out with the following updates:
    Mixed mode debugging [Beta]
    This update introduces a beta version of mixed mode debugging â€“ a capability that lets you debug both .NET and C/C++ code in a single session. The current implementation supports only the Mono Windows x64 scenario.
    To enable the mixed mode debugging in Rider 2025.1.2, go to Help | Find Action, type in Registry, and open it. Then search for the rider.debugger.enable.mono.mixed.mode flag name and check the box to enable it.
    If you encounter any issues while using the beta version of this feature or would like to share feedback, please leave a comment to this ticket.
