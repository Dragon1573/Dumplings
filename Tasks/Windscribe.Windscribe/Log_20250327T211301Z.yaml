    Improved
    - Decoy Traffic algorithm data rate limits on high-bandwidth networks.
    Known Issues:
    - Windows: the Circumvent Censorship feature does nothing when using the TCP protocol due to a missing feature in the OpenVPN DCO driver. If you require use of the TCP protocol and the Circumvent Censorship feature, you can add ws-use-openvpn-wintun to the Advanced Parameters setting to force the use of the wintun driver.
