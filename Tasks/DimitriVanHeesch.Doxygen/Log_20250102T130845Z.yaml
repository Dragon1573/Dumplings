    Minor incompatibilities
    - As of doxygen version 1.13.1 and layout version 2.0, Doxygen will insert defaults for elements that are missing in the user defined layout file. This allows for the introduction of new elements, without having to update the user defined layout files to make them appear. For older Doxygen or layout versions, missing elements are still treated as being invisible as before.
