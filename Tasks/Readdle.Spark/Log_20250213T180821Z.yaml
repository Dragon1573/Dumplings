    This update brings stability improvements and bug fixes:
    - Fixed an issue preventing logins for non-Gmail accounts. Spark incorrectly displayed the Gmail login page instead of the correct login pages for other providers.
    - Fixed an issue causing the Calendar tab to close unexpectedly in certain scenarios, redirecting users to the Inbox.
    - Improved template sorting in search resultsâ€”teams with matching templates now appear first, making it easier to find the right one.
    This release also includes UI adjustments, refinements for right-to-left (RTL) text display, style enhancements, and general performance optimizations.
