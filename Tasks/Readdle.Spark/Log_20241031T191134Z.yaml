    Hey everyone!
    There’s more than meets the eye in today’s small, yet mighty update to Spark:

    - Improved mini-calendar with clearer highlighting of current day and easier selection of month and year
    - The "Meet with..." feature now displays available slots for the entire week, with an updated design for a more cohesive look.
    - The "Meet with..." feature is now available in both Day and Month calendar views, offering broader usability.
    - Adjusted logic for calculating free time slots within the "Meet with..." feature
    - Updated the user interface for pending invitations to provide clearer status visibility.
    - Events now show a slight shift in creation date on the day view, enhancing timeline accuracy.
    - Fixed an issue where switching focus to another event preview while creating a new event could not cause an error.
