    Hi all,

    New neat update brings you important fixes to the Calendar feature:

    - Fixed an issue where non-English localizations displayed incorrect day names in the Month view.
    - Resolved a problem where autocomplete interfered with using the Enter key to create events.
    - Corrected an issue where pressing ESC during event name autocomplete would close the entire Create Event window.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented selecting an autocomplete suggestion if it matched an existing event name.
    - Adjusted the autocomplete behavior to avoid automatically selecting the first option when pressing Enter.

    Additionally, weâ€™ve updated the legal disclaimer copy for Spark +AI features to ensure clarity and compliance.

    Thank you for choosing Spark! We value your feedback. Please contact us at support@sparkmailapp.com with any questions or suggestions.
