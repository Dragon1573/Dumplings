    Today’s update brings you a handful of important fixes to Spark and the Calendar feature in particular.
    Calendar Improvements:
    – Time Display Fix: we fixed the issue where the calendar showed a 12-hour clock even if you preferred a 24-hour format.
    – Better Event Handling: Now you can easily drag and resize events, even when the event details are open. Plus, you can create new events by dragging on the calendar grid.

    New Features:
    – Quick Switch Shortcuts: Switch quickly between your Inbox and Calendar with new handy shortcuts.
    – Custom Time Display: Choose how you want to see your calendar’s time periods, just like in Spark 2!

    Additional Enhancements:
    – Open Links and Locations: Spark 3 now lets you open addresses and links directly from the location field.
    – UI Updates: We’ve made many improvements to the look and feel for a smoother experience.
    We hope you love these updates! Stay connected with us at support@sparkmailapp.com for any questions and keep an eye out for more exciting features!
