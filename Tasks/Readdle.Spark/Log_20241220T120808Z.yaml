    Hello,
    This update is for those who needed more personalization options to turn off specific parts of the new +AI Meeting Notes feature. We apologize for any frustrations caused by unclear or limited settings, and we focused on addressing these issues first to prevent other users from experiencing them.
    - We’ve updated the wording to clarify the settings for disabling the status bar icon (on Mac) and the Agenda option (on Windows), in case you don’t use the Calendar Agenda feature. We’ve also moved this option to Settings -> General for better discoverability.
    - Additionally, we've fixed an issue with the onboarding pop-up for the +AI Meeting Notes feature—new users will now only see it once.
    - We’ve added a setting to disable the automatic meeting call detection pop-ups (Meeting Notes -> Meeting Notification Pop-Up -> Automatically Detect Meetings toggle), as well as a setting to turn off automatic calendar event creation for ad-hoc meeting transcription in Spark +AI -> Transcription and Summarizing Settings.
    - We've also made some other UI improvements and fixes.
    Rest assured, we’re continuing to improve the core email functionality—stay tuned for a major update related to the improved email experience, coming soon!
    For any questions or suggestions, please contact us at support@sparkmailapp.com.
