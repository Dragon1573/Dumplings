    Hello,
    This update is for those who needed more personalization options to turn off specific parts of the new +AI Meeting Notes feature. We apologize for any frustrations caused by unclear or limited settings, and we focused on addressing these issues first to prevent other users from experiencing them.
    - We’ve updated the wording to clarify the settings for disabling the Agenda option (on Windows), in case you don’t use it. We’ve also moved this option to Settings -> General for better discoverability.
    - Additionally, we've fixed an issue with the onboarding pop-up for the +AI Meeting Notes feature—new users will now only see it once.
    - We’ve added a setting to disable the automatic meeting call detection pop-ups (Meeting Notes -> Meeting Notification Pop-Up -> Automatically Detect Meetings toggle), as well as a setting to turn off automatic calendar event creation for ad-hoc meeting transcription in Spark +AI -> Transcription and Summarizing Settings.
    - We've also made some other UI improvements and fixes.
    Rest assured, we’re continuing to improve the core email functionality—stay tuned for a major update related to the improved email experience, coming soon!
    For any questions or suggestions, please contact us at support@sparkmailapp.com.
