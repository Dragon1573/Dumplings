    Hey everyone!
    There’s more than meets the eye in today’s small, yet mighty update to Spark:

    - Added a new option that allows users to view all ‘Priority’ emails for better email management.
    - Adjusted the behavior of the composer when opened from the calendar, improving the user experience.
    - Updated the content of the warning message shown when users edit calendar events, making it clearer and more informative.
    - Fixed an issue where the calendar view would scroll to the center when opening event previews after midday.
    - Resolved a problem where the ‘Back to Home Screen’ button on the sidebar was unresponsive when navigating from the calendar.
    - Fixed the bug that prevented users from changing the custom recurrence options (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) during event creation or editing.
    - Spark now correctly handles backlinks when no authorization process is running, improving reliability.
    - Corrected the display issue with shared calendar slots, ensuring they now appear accurately.
    - Fixed the issue where links to calls created in Amie were not being displayed in Spark.
