    In this update, we've made improvements in the new inbox views and in multi-window support.
    More about this features:
    What’s New
    - Fast inbox switching. Focus on important messages, batch process unread emails, or jump to the most recent email.
    - Customize your inbox views. Open Spark Settings > Inbox to tailor Spark to your preferred workflow.
    - Multiple windows: Pop out emails and the composer in separate windows. You can write replies, compare threads, or keep relevant messages visible while you work.
    How to Open Emails in a New Window
    - Double-click any email in your list or use the Command Center action.
    - Or use a shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + N
    - To set this as the default: Go to Settings > General and enable “Always open the thread viewer in a new window.”
    How to Compose Emails in a New Window
    - Click the “Open in new window” icon in the composer toolbar.
    - Or use the same shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + N
    - To always compose in a new window: Go to Settings > Composer and enable “Always open the composer in a new window.”
