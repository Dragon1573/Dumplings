    Hello,
    This hotfix update includes improvements and fixes for issues reported by customers who tried the +AI Meeting Notes feature:
    - We’ve improved the ad-hoc meeting detection, so pop-ups won’t appear when launching from apps that aren’t related to calls.
    - We’ve fixed the crashes that were happening on Mac mini and Mac Pro.
