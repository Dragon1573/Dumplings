    Added the security check code on the read/write/ioctl procedures on the Win10Pcap kernel-mode driver. In the previous version of Win10Pcap, the kernel-mode driver did not check the virtual addresses which are passed from the user-mode. A local user was able to exploit this to read or write data bytes in the kernel-space memory. This had a risk to allow a local user to gain the escalated privilege on the local system. This security check code is to prevent such as illegal access from a local user. For details, please see https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/Win10Pcap/commits/master.
    The problem was reported by Meysam Firozi on October 7, 2015. I greatly appreciate Meysam Firozi's contribution to report this problem.
