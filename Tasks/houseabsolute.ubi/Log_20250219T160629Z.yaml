    - On Windows, ubi now looks for files with .bat extensions as an executable. This applies both
      to releases of standalone files and executables in an archive file (tarball or zip). Based on work
      by @timothysparg (Tim Sparg) in PR #97.
    - If there are no files that are an exact match for the project name in an archive file, ubi will
      now look for files that start with the project name. On non-Windows, boxes, this will only match
      executables. On Windows, this will only match .bat or .exe files. Based on work by
      @timothysparg (Tim Sparg) in PR #97.
