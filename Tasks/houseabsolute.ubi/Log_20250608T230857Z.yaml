    - Added a new --matching-regex CLI flag and UbiBuilder::matching_regex method. This regex is
      matched against potential release filenames before attempting to find a release with a matching
      OS, architecture, etc. This is useful for doing things like filtering for a single tool when a
      project releases multiple tools in a single GitHub release. PR by @yjoer (Yeoh Joer). GH #122.
    - The logic for determining whether or not to include a top-level directory when --extract-all is
      passed has been fixed. Previously, if the directory where the archive was extracted into was not
      empty, then when ubi checked for whether it should ignore a top-level directory in the archive,
      it would see these files, and never ignore the top-level directory. Now it extracts the archive
      into a temp directory and checks that. This makes the behavior of --extract-all more
      predictable, and it means you can use to, for example, extract an archive into an existing tree,
      like ~/.local, that contains ~/.local/bin, ~/.local/share, etc. Reported by @jinnatar (Jinna
      Kiisuo). GH #106.
    - Changed dependency declarations to mostly eliminate default features, which removed quite a few
      transitive dependencies.
