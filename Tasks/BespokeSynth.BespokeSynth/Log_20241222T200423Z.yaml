    hello everyone! yesterday was the december solstice, so let's start our new solar year with a new version of bespoke: 1.3.0!
    big thanks to everyone in the bespoke community for pull requests and issue reports, and an extra special big thanks to @NoxyNixie for joining as a project maintainer, to solve the problem of me falling behind on merging everyone's excellent PRs. there's a bunch of new stuff in this release, and if you've been keeping up with bespoke's nightly builds, you're already familiar with all of these new features. but if you haven't here's some of the highlights!
    - new modules: dotsequencer, rhythmsequencer, euclideansequencer, controlrecorder, pulserouter, audiosplitter, pitchtovalue, voicesetter, savestateloader, dataprovider, pulselimit, label
    - added the ability to save module presets (look in the triangle menu!), and spawn those presets directly from the quickspawn menu
    - more flexible pulse functionality: pulse cables can now be directly wired into buttons, checkboxes, dropdown lists, and radio buttons
    - added a new "list" view mode to the snapshots module to make it more convenient, and made snapshots able to store the state of grids and canvases
    - added 14-bit MIDI CC support
    - added new "ratio" sync mode to oscillator and signalgenerator
    - improved workflow for editing velocity on sequencers, by hovering and using the up and down arrow keyboard keys
    - made "bypass" functionality consistent across all audio modules
    - added the ability to use your computer keyboard as a midicontroller source
    - lots of bug fixes
    take a look at CHANGELOG.md for a more thorough breakdown of all changes since 1.2.1
    enjoy!
