    this is primarily a bugfix release to fix the following two major issues with 1.2.0:
    - some older bespoke patches (including several of the included example files!) weren't loading
    - bespoke would sometimes fail to start properly on macOS13 in certain audio configurations
    a few other features and tweaks snuck in as well. take a look at CHANGELOG.md for a breakdown of all changes since 1.2.0
    enjoy!
