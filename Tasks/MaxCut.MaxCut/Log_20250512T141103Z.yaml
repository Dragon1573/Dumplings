    New Features
    - Faster Input Item Entry with “Add Another” Option
      Adding multiple input items is now faster and smoother with the new “Add Another” button. This lets you quickly save an item and immediately start the next one—no need to repeat the full add process each time.
    Updates
    - Smarter File Import Handling
      MaxCut now automatically detects and handles file formats during import—if you choose the import Excel option with a CSV file (or vice versa), MaxCut will detect the correct format.

    - Improved Panel Rotation Settings
      Rotation settings like “Never rotate,” “Always allow rotation,” and others now include clear, descriptive text to help you understand exactly how your panel will align with the sheet material. This update reduces confusion and ensures more predictable results during layout setup.

    - Consistent Terminology in CSV/XLSX Exports
      CSV and Excel file exports now use the same standardized rotation options as the MaxCut interface—“Never rotate,” “Always allow rotation,” and more—making it easier to prepare and review data without needing to cross-reference terminology.
    Fixes
    - Reliable License Transfers
      Transferring a license to another machine now works reliably. You no longer need to deactivate it first—simply activate it on the new machine, and MaxCut will handle the move for you.

    - Label Printing Alignment
      70 mm x 25.4 mm : A4 Page, 33 Labels are now aligned correctly, ready for printing.

    - Accurate Arabic/Hebrew Print Layouts
      Printed layouts now match the on-screen optimization when using right-to-left languages such as Arabic and Hebrew, ensuring consistent and accurate output.

    - Optimization Screen Keyboard Navigation
      Keyboard navigation on the Optimized Results screen now functions smoothly, allowing efficient and consistent interaction without unexpected behavior.
