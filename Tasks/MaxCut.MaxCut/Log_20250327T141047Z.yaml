        Understanding the Excel Import Dialog
    Updates
    - Improved Panel Selection in Optimization View
      - Left-clicking on the expanded part of a panel now also selects the panel.
      - Right-clicking on the expanded part of a panel now brings up the same context menu as clicking directly on the panel.

    - Enhanced KD Max Import Handling for Panel Thickness
      - To reduce errors when selecting a material during import, MaxCut now:
        1. Attempts to find a material that matches the material name (from the import).
        2. If no exact match is found, it looks for a material matching name - thickness mm.
        3. If there is still no match, the user will be prompted to select a replacement.

           Example:
           - Imported Name: White Example Board
           - Imported Thickness: 18 mm
           - MaxCut will match against:
             - White Example Board
             - White Example Board - 18 mm

    - Smoother Downgrade Experience to Community Edition
      - If your MaxCut downgrades from Business Edition to Community Edition (for whatever reason), we've improved the process to make it easier to get back up and running.
      - A clearer dialog box now guides you through the steps:
        - Step 1: Reactivate your subscription (Green button)
        - Step 2: Check your subscription status (New button)
