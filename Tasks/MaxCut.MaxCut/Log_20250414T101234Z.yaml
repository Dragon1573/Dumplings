    Updates
    - Faster Input Item Actions
      We’ve significantly improved the speed and responsiveness of working with input items—actions like selecting, cutting, deleting, pasting, duplicating, importing, grouping, ungrouping, and moving items are now much faster, making your workflow smoother and more efficient.
    Fixes
    - The Job Costing Summary report now prints correctly when using large, high-resolution logos with centering and scaling enabled. Logos are automatically scaled to fit within the page, ensuring smooth printing without errors—even in landscape layouts.
