    New Features
    - Added Avery 5160 Label Format
      You can now generate labels using the Avery 5160 template—designed for 30 labels per US Letter sheet (3 columns × 10 rows), each label measuring 2 5/8" x 1" (66.7 x 25.4 mm). This format is commonly used in the United States and Canada. It closely matches MaxCut’s existing A4 24-label report, ensuring your key part details and edging visuals remain clear and well-formatted.
    Updates
    - Consistent Ordering for Input Item Types
      The order of input item types now appears consistently across both the Library and Add Prompt interfaces, helping you find what you need faster.

    - Enhanced Edging Visibility on Current Layout Reports
      Edging now appears clearly in layout reports, thanks to an increase in line thickness. This makes the edging much easier to see after printing, ensuring greater accuracy and legibility in your documentation.
    Fixes
    - Edging Displayed on Current Layout Report
      Panels in the Current Layout report now correctly show edging, ensuring visual accuracy right from the start.

    - CSV Import: “Don’t Ask Again” Setting Persists
      The “Don’t Ask Again” checkbox for CSV imports now reliably retains your preference between MaxCut sessions.

    - “Add Another” Now Works in Add Prompt Flow
      When adding input items via the Add Prompt, the “Add Another” button now correctly reopens the dialog to continue adding items, eliminating unnecessary clicks.

    - Unified Font Defaults Across Sessions
      On-screen font sizes now start with consistent and more practical defaults:
      - Panel Font Size: 48
      - Panel Dimension Font Size: 42
      - Panel Sheet Dimension Font Size: 42
        These sizes apply both at first launch and when restoring defaults, improving panel readability and label fit.
