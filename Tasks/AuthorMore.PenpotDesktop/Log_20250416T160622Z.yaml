    Features
    - [BREAKING CHANGE] Added color setting validation. #126
      Added color setting validation to ensure correct theme application and fixed tabs' background with the default instance colour. In addition to the general validity rules of the HSLA colour format, it checks for quirks of the colour picker that the app is using.
      Who is affected?
      ‚ö†Ô∏è If you manually edited a colour in the settings file and a color value has an incompatible format, you should receive an error report on launch. The settings won't be lost, they will be backed up and available for you to reapply - it is detailed in the error report.
      üü¢ If you haven't manually changed a color setting from the default value or used only the settings panel to set your instances' colours, you shouldn‚Äôt be affected. Although the old default value for the color setting was invalid, the app will update it with the new, valid, default value before validating the format.
    Fixes
    - Fixed theme to set without media change on initialisation. #129
      The fix addresses a situation where a theme would not be completely set in the application, resulting in it mixing with another theme‚Äôs style. For example, the light theme‚Äôs text colour being used in the dark theme.
