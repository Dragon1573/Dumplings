    Features
    - Added new user interface (UI) design.
      The new UI is unified and seamlessly integrates with the look of the Penpot app while maintaining familiarity. It’s based on the concept by @mayrinck and Penpot’s official design system, Pencil.
      The most notable changes are:
      - Colour palette(s) are unified across UI elements.
      - Colour coding is consistent between themes.
      - A tab's background colour is tinted with its instance's assigned colour.
      - The tab opening menu features colour coding.
