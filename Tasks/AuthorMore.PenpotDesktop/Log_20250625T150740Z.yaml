    Features
    - Added batch download of projects. #172
      Added an option to download all Penpot projects as a zip archive. After selecting a download path, the files of all projects will be downloaded and placed inside a zip archive, organised within a directory corresponding to each project's name.

    Fixes
    - Fixed instance creator to show only the most relevant alert. #169
      Resolves the case when the missing Docker alert is shown together with the sandbox environment alert. A sandbox environment doesnâ€™t have access to Docker, making the instruction to install it misleading.
