    Fixes
    - Fixed a colourless tab to have active and hover states.
    - Fixed top bar spacing.
      Fixed positioning of elements in the top bar. “Add/New tab” button now docks next to the window controls on Linux and Windows. On macOS, controls and tabs now fill the space of the traffic lights while in full-screen mode.
    - Fixed in-app navigation to use the active tab’s instance.
      Fixed in-app tab navigation (e.g. opening a resource in a new tab) to use the active tab’s instance. It resolves the situation when a new tab would be opened outside the original tab’s instance and without necessary context, e.g. opening a project preview in an instance where it doesn’t exist.
