    Fixes
    - Fixed top bar spacing with native title bar enabled #157, #160
      Fixed the top bar to use the space freed by the window controls when the native title bar is enabled.
    - [Linux] Fixed the app to run with Gnome #158
      Version 36 of Electron introduced a breaking change (inherited from its Chrome update) by setting GTK version 4 as the default. This fix implements a workaround to use the GTK v3.
