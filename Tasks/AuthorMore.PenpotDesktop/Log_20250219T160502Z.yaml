    Features
    - [BREAKING CHANGE] Added file based settings.
      Added file based configuration system for settings. Now you can move or sync Penpot Desktop’s settings between devices, share it with a team, or include in a back-up.
      Settings are held in a human-readable, settings.json file. The directory with an application's user files is specific to an operating system and its configuration, but you can read about the default setup in Electron's documentation - see userData path for app.getPath method.
      ⚠️ It is a breaking change. After the upgrade, the settings will have default values and you will need to set them back to the preferred ones.
    Fixes
    - [Flathub] Fixed file selector dialog to use portals. By @Beryesa.
      Electron v34 restored portals for file selector dialog. The Flathub version of Penpot Desktop will no longer require access to Downloads and Documents directories.
    Internal
    - Added dependencies update automation.
      Configured Dependabot for automatic dependency updates. Suggested in #54.
