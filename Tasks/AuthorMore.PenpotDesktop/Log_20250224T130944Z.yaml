    Features
    - Added support for multiple instances.
      You can now open and manage multiple Penpot instances at the same time, each in its own color-coded tab for easy identification.
      - A new option in the context menu of the "Add Tab" button allows you to quickly open a specific instance.
      - Instances with the same origin are treated as separate, persistent sessions, allowing you to log in to different accounts (e.g., work, personal).
      - Instance management is accessible through the app's settings, where you can also set the default instance via the context menu for the instance entry.
