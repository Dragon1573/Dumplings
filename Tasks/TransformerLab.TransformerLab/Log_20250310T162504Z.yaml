    Installer + Settings
    - A new Settings UI allows you to configure third-party LLM services like OpenAI and Anthropic. These services can be used throughout the app for tasks like judging or data generation.
    - For debugging purposes, you can view all active engine tasks in Settings → Jobs.
    - The Computer Tab now includes a scrollbar when you have more than 3 GPUs, so you can see all your GPUs (must be nice!).
    - Fixed a bug where having a .python_version file in your home directory would interfere with uv's Python version selection.
    - The new AI Providers tab in Settings lets you add API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, and custom providers:
      - API keys now persist between app startups
      - Custom Model Provider APIs can be configured here and used for evaluations or generation
    Datasets
    - We improved how datasets display, particularly those containing very large fields
    - Datasets requiring a config_name now allow you to specify the config during download
    Documents
    - Fixed bugs affecting document deletion and updates for files stored in folders
    - Added the ability to sort documents by name
    - Improved the visual design of the Documents page
    Evals
    - Charting
      - Visualize individual evals using line, bar, or radar graphs
      - Compare multiple evals using interactive charts
      - Generate detailed comparative reports between evals
      - Enhanced chart visuals with improved legends and formatting
    - Comparing Evals
      - Compare results across multiple eval runs
      - Generate detailed side-by-side comparisons for each test case, with downloadable CSV reports
      - View summary charts comparing all selected eval jobs
      - Display line graphs with flexible axis options—view by metric or by compared job
    - New Eval Plugins:
      - Basic Evals Plugin: Perform fundamental checks on model outputs, including JSON validation and bullet list detection
        - Create custom evaluations using regex patterns or exact string matching
      - Red Teaming Plugin: Test LLM vulnerabilities using DeepEval's capabilities across multiple categories: Bias, Misinformation, PII Leakage, Personal Safety, Toxicity, Robustness, Unauthorized Access, Illegal Activity, Graphic Content, and Intellectual Property Infringement
      - Common EleutherAI Harness Plugin: Run key benchmarks using a streamlined version of the EleutherAI Harness plugin
    Training:
    - Multi-GPU support
      - Multi-GPU training support for Llama Trainer via dedicated plugin
      - GRPO training support with multi-GPU configuration on a separate plugin
    - Pre-training
      - New pre-training plugin using Nanotron for LLMs, initially supporting LlamaForCausalLM config with planned expansion to MoE and Mamba (state-space) models
    - Embedding Models: Fine-tune embedding models with comprehensive dataset types and loss functions
      - Supports all dataset types and loss functions documented at https://sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/loss_overview.html
      - Models are automatically stored locally and imported into Transformer Lab
      - Support for FP16 and BF16 options
      - Additional loss modifiers for model size and performance optimization
    Backend:
    - SQLAlchemy Integration
      - Started migrating database access to SQLAlchemy, enabling future ORM capabilities and Alembic migrations
    - Testing Infrastructure
      - Implemented foundational unit tests using pytest
    - Docker:
      - Updated CPU and GPU Dockerfiles in main branch
      - Published v0.10.2 CPU and GPU images to Transformer Lab dockerhub
      - Updated docker-compose file for direct execution
      - Verified CPU docker images on Mac, Ubuntu, and Windows
    - Fixed local model import issue
    - Enhanced API Security
      - Strengthened API endpoints to ensure compliance with future security audits
