    You can now review code in Haystack! And we have some improvements/bug fixes on the side as well.

    Improvements:
    1. Dramatically improved canvas performance with many editors
    2. Fixed camera panning issues when focusing on an editor
    3. Fixed editor width shrinking bug when typing into a new editor
    4. Fixed "Compare active file with..." functionality
    5. Dependency arrows can now be left clicked to go to the target, and right clicked to go to the source

    üìù New Code Review Feature:
    You can now review GitHub PRs directly on canvas. Currently, you can only view a pull request on the canvas as a dependency graph, but we plan on adding ways to customize this view soon!

    How to review code in Haystack:
    1. Click "review pull request" in the top navbar
    2. Select a PR from dropdown or enter a PR‚Äôs URL
    3. Add comments via ‚Äúplus‚Äù icon on line numbers
    4. Submit reviews/edit PR via the ‚Äúedit pull request or submit a review‚Äù button on the top right of the canvas
    5. Exit the review via the ‚Äúexit pull request‚Äù button in the top navbar

    We welcome any and all feedback on the code review experience.
