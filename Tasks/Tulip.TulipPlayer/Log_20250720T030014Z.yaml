    Version 2.8.2 of Desktop Player will be available for download by 9:00PM ET tomorrow (July 19th, 2025)! If you have auto updates enabled, the Desktop Player application will update in the background and changes will take effect the next time the application is restarted. Alternatively, you can manually initiate the update process from the file menu.
    Feature Enhancements
    - On the MT-SICS driver, a new function, 'disconnect' is added. 'Disconnect' can be used to disconnect from scale.
    - Fixes for the Node Open Protocol library address two main issues: it now correctly reports connection errors when a controller is faulty, and it prevents internal crashes by properly understanding controller acknowledgments, ensuring applications receive timely updates.
