    Quality of Life Update | Zettelkasten Link Improvements
    This update contains many smaller fixes and improvements of the app. The primary changes are a complete update of the various dependencies so that the app is up-to-date, including the most recent Electron framework and the most recent Pandoc. It also contains a few fixes for exports and translation improvements. Refer to the changelog below for a full list of changes.
    Note that we have updated the build pipeline to Ubuntu 22.04, which means that any older Ubuntu-system likely won't be able to run this version of Zettlr.
    Changelog
    GUI and Functionality
    - Change: The exporter will now forcefully enable (= if it is not yet
      enabled in the corresponding defaults file in the assets manager) the Pandoc
      extension wikilinks_title_after_pipe or wikilinks_title_before_pipe
      (depending on your settings) for every export from a supported (Markdown-
      based) reader so that wikilinks/Zettelkasten links are properly parsed.
    - Identification of Pandoc readers and writers is now more stable, resulting in
      clearer information across the app.
    - Fix the wikilink/Zettelkasten link Lua filter (#5605).
    - Zettlr now properly retrieves attachments also for items residing in group
      libraries (#5647).
    - Updated translations:
      - German (de-DE)
      - French (fr-FR, #5688)
      - Taiwanese (zh-TW, #5656)
    Under the Hood
    - Import Pandoc reader/writer parser from
      nathanlesage/pandoc-profile-generator; retire getPlainPandocReaderWriter.
    - Move pandoc-maps.ts to common pandoc-util location.
    - Add additional classes to Table of Contents-headings in the sidebar to allow
      targeting them with Custom CSS rules (toc-heading-X where X is the level).
    - Bump Electron to v35.1.5.
    - Bump Pandoc to v3.6.4
    - Bump Node.js across the CI to v22 (LTS).
