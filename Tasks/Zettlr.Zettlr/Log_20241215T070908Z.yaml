    Fix Images and Links on Windows
    Some days are just bad days, and today was one such for us: In version 3.3.0, we accidentally broke all images, links, and file previews for Windows users. This patch fixes this. Sorry for the inconvenience! Have a great day, now with an actually working update to your favorite writing app!
