    Quality of Life Update
    This update is the second one in our roadmap to exchange Zettlr's code signing certificate, meaning that it doesn't contain all that much new functionality. Instead, it is relevant mostly to Windows users. Please try to install this update. If it doesn't work, read on for a link to the one-week old 3.4.2 release. Thanks for bearing with us!

    An Important Note for Windows Users
    If you use Zettlr on Windows, there is a chance that you will be unable to
    install this update at first. This is because this update uses a different, new
    code signing certificate. There is a possibility that especially those of you
    who use a work computer on which you do not have administrative access, Windows
    will warn you of this update and prevent you from installing it. Based on
    initial communication, there are indications that this won't happen, but we
    wanted to let you know just in case.
    If you are unable to install this update, please make sure you update to at
    least version 3.4.2, which has been released last week. If you did not update to
    version 3.4.2, you can find do so
    by clicking this link.
    For more context, please read our blog post
    that outlines our roadmap for the code signing certificate change, as well as
    our Community Forum post.
    If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask them
    on the Community Forum,
    on Discord, or
    as a comment on our BlueSky or
    Mastodon accounts.
