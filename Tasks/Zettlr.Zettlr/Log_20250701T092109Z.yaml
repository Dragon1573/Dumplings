    Changelog
    GUI and Functionality
    - Fixed a bug that would make using certain keys such as Enter, Backspace,
      or quotes in code editors in the Assets Manager unusable (#5797).
    - Added Kazakh language (#5771).
    - Improve fenced code block language detection when using fenced code
      attributes. Now, using the recommended Pandoc-style syntax for attribute
      strings will correctly match the language in the info string to one of the
      available identifiers.
