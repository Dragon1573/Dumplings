    - Profiler: Fixed "Page range is outside of system region range. Please report a bug!" error for captured memory snapshots and opened in the Memory Profiler packaged, caused by Unity Objects getting created in-between of capturing the Managed Heap and Native Object data. Snapshots before this fix are not fixed by this change but future captures won't have the same issue. This also fixes cases where Unity Objects in a Memory Snapshot might have pointed at invalid data for their Managed Shell, which may have been most notable with MonoBehaviour and ScriptableObject types. This may also have fixed a vanishingly small amount of instances of reported "Leaked Managed Shell" objects where the Native Object part of the object got destroyed just after the managed Heap data was captured. The close timing makes the likelihood of all of these issues very rare and more likely the longer it takes to capture a snapshot. (UUM-77449)

    - Shadergraph: Fixed a bug that Normal From Height node in a shader graph might return an invalid value when using 16-bit half precision. (UUM-72722)
    - Shadergraph: Fixed a bug where the Custom Function node's "Body" field would expand off-screen instead of scrolling. (UUM-76270)
    - Shadergraph: The name displayed in the Graph inspector when a BlockNode is selected has changed. (UUM-76081)
    - Shadergraph: Users can no longer select 'Delete' for context blocks. (UUM-76198)
    - SpeedTree: Camera facing leaves (cards) are facing incorrect direction. (UUM-70196)
    - SpeedTree: SpeedTree LOD Transition effect applying only to wind-enabled assets in SRP. (UUM-73540)
    - Universal RP: Fixed an issue where glClientWaitSync: Expected application to have kicked everything until job: 96089 (possibly by calling glFlush)" are thrown in the Android Player on some devices with PowerVR Rogue GE8320 GPU. (UUM-59572)

    - VFX Graph: Read unexposed shader global properties when using a Shader Graph output. (UUM-78383)
