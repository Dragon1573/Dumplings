    ‎
    - In Outline Folding mode, the hidden headings are now greyed out in the Navigator instead of not being visible. tdf#156282 (Jim Raykowski)
    ‎
    - Comments in a thread are now grouped in the Navigator. tdf#157729 (Jim Raykowski)
    ‎

    Multi-page floating tables
    Support for multi-page floating tables was improved in various aspects:
    - Overlap control, border and footnotes: blog post (Miklos Vajna, Collabora)
    - Nesting: blog post (Miklos Vajna, Collabora)
    - Wrap on all pages: blog post (Miklos Vajna, Collabora)
    - UI improvements: blog post (Miklos Vajna, Collabora)
    Templates
    - Templates with the required settings for Japanese text added to the Localization category. This increases interoperability with Microsoft Word for Japanese users. tdf#86483, feeb3a46 (Jun Nogata)
    ‎
    New line break algorithm for interoperability
    Since 2013, the non-proprietary, metric-compatible alternative fonts are no longer guaranteed the same paragraph layout, because MS Word 2013 and later introduced a new default line breaking algorithm for justified text. To fix the lost interoperability, the same algorithm has been implemented in Writer to reduce spaces within justified lines by up to 20%. tdf#119908 blog post (László Németh, donor: NLnet).
    For example, the 2-page test document in Writer has been reduced to one page, just like in MS Word, as visible on the following composite image (red text typeset by MS Word, which covered by the black text typeset by LibreOffice Writer). After the development, the red MS Word text is visible only at high magnification next to the black Writer letters, as the line breaks are already exactly the same:

    Note: used only for DOCX interoperability at the moment (including for ODT files which are converted from new DOCX files with space shrinking), but planned to be the default justification algorithm of the next major versions of LibreOffice.

      - Accessible through Tools ▸ Options ▸ LibreOffice Calc ▸ View, or through the menu entry View ▸ Column/Row Highlighting

        ‎
    - When copying formulas made visible with View ▸ Show Formula (shortcut: Ctrl + `), pasting them in a plain text editor will show the formulas (instead of the results). They can also be pasted into Writer using Edit ▸ Paste Special ▸ Unformatted Text. tdf#156357 (Heiko Tietze, TDF)
    ‎
    - 24.2.5

    Core / General
    - A new calendar-based numbering scheme (YY.M.Patch) is introduced since this release. This will help users to more easily see how current their installed version of LibreOffice is.
    - Changes in automatic saving of documents: "Save AutoRecovery information" is turned on by default, as well as "Always create backup copies". Backup copies accumulate in the folder specified by Tools ▸ Options ▸ LibreOffice ▸ Paths. Both settings can be turned off in Tools ▸ Options ▸ Load/Save ▸ General ▸ Save. tdf#152463 (Bogdan Buzea)
    - Fixed many AutoRecovery limitations and re-enabled AutoSave UI. Added "Place backup in same folder as document" option. tdf#65509 tdf#68565 tdf#57414 (Mike Kaganski / Justin Luth, Collabora)
    - Fixed various Notebookbar paper cuts: lots of menu improvements, better print preview support, proper reset of customized layout, better use of radio buttons, less "jumps" back to Home tab, no longer broken after file reload or print preview or master view. tdf#126006 tdf#125504 tdf#122270 tdf#141136 tdf#148121 (Justin Luth)
    - Help ▸ Search Commands now also matches submenu names to return more relevant results. tdf#157114 (Dung Saga)

    - Improved editing capabilities in Expert config dialog: (Samuel Mehrbrodt, allotropia)
      - Proper input type validation
      - Editing lists in an own dialog
    - Sometimes spell checker algorithms send 2 lists for the same part of the sentence. One of the lists is sometimes empty. Now the non-empty list is shown on right click. (Gökay Şatır, Collabora Productivity)
    - Null pointer issue in password-dialog / libreofficeKit is fixed. (Gökay Şatır, Collabora Productivity)
    - Duden corrector encoded text issue is fixed. (Gökay Şatır, Collabora Productivity)

    - On Windows, Alt + NumPad codes support had been enhanced to allow full Unicode range. Note that this interferes with shortcut handling; Alt + Number shortcuts now only work with main keyboard area numbers on Windows, not with NumPad numbers. Also note, that this enhancement does not include Windows' EnableHexNumpad registry setting support. tdf#156443 (Mike Kaganski, Collabora)
    - Introduced additional editable metadata fields Contributor, Coverage, Identifier, Publisher, Relation, Rights, Source, Type. See File ▸ Properties... ▸ Description. tdf#138792 (Sarper Akdemir, allotropia)

    Filters
    Orcus-based filters
    The following improvements derive primarily from the 0.19 release of the orcus library (Kohei Yoshida, allotropia).
    - Overhauled the Gnumeric import filter to fix bugs and add missing features. Most notable feature additions are:
      - cell styles
      - rich-text strings
      - named ranges
      - row heights and column widths
      - merged cells
    - Added support for importing rich-text strings in the Excel 2003 XML format.

    Import of "Drawing Canvas" from docx-documents
    Word has an object called "Drawing Canvas" where you draw shapes on it. They are combined into one object, similar as grouping them. This drawing canvas has to be used in Word, if the drawing contains connector shapes. Word writes this object in two flavors to the file. One is the original drawing canvas in DrawingML markup and the other is a fallback with reduced properties in VML markup. Previous LibreOffice versions could only read the VML fallback. Now the DrawingML is read. That gives you these new import features:
    - The drawing canvas background is imported.
    - Connectors are no longer imported as simple shapes but as true connectors, attached to the start and end shape.
    - Primitive shapes like ellipses are imported as ooxml-shape and thus text inside the shape can wrap now.
    - Shapes can use multicolor gradients, theme colors and glow effects.
    (Regina)
    ODF Wholesome Encryption
    A new mode of password-based ODF encryption has been implemented, with the following advantages:
    - more performant due to deriving a key only once per package
    - more tamper-resistant with authenticated encryption (AES-GCM)
    - better hiding of metadata to reduce information leaks
    - higher resistance to brute forcing using memory-hard Argon2id key derivation function
    Warning:
    You will need LibreOffice 24.2 to open these encrypted files. For this reason, by default the pre-existing standard ODF encryption is used.

    This is available if Experimental Features are enabled in Tools ▸ Options ▸ LibreOffice ▸ Advanced. tdf#105844 (Michael Stahl, allotropia)

    SVG support
    - 24.2.2
      Support for SVG styles parameters: style="overflow:notset", ...:hidden" and ...:visible". (Xisco Fauli, TDF) tdf#159968
    ‎
    - 24.2.3
      Translations stored in <switch> elements are now selected based on the system locale's language tag. (Xisco Fauli, TDF) tdf#160386
    ‎
    - 24.2.4
      Support SVG 2 values context-fill and context-stroke. (Xisco Fauli, TDF) tdf#155651
    ‎
    OOXML SVG support
    - Support SVG OOXML extension (http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/drawing/2016/SVG/main namespace)
    - Import the SVG image (svgBlip element) instead of the fallback PNG.
    - Export the SVG image in addition to fallback PNG image, which is used if the svgBlip element is not supported (older MS Office versions). tdf#51510, tdf#126084 (Tomaž Vajngerl, Collabora)
    ‎

    WMF
    - Fix displaying images with size of EOF other than 3. tdf#155887 (Bartosz Kosiorek)

    GUI
    - The Insert Special Characters dropdown now shows a character description for the selected character (and in tooltip on hovering). tdf#156538 (Jim Raykowski)
    ‎
    - The save with password dialog now features a password strength meter that utilizes zxcvbn-c to determine the password strength. tdf#157518 (Sarper Akdemir, allotropia)
    ‎
    - Turn Security Warnings popup windows into infobars to avoid annoying blocker warning dialogs. tdf#157482 (Balázs Varga, allotropia) - In the previous implementation, if the appropriate configuration options are enabled, a warning was issued and/or the personal information have been removed each time the document is saved. These Security Warnings popup windows have been turned into individual infobar warnings at the top of the page. The infobar can be displayed both for hidden and for personal information. In this way, the user receives a hint without significantly disrupting the workflow. A button on the banner could additionally open a dialog in which individual pieces of information can be removed.
    ‎
    - Options dialog pages behaved inconsistently when options are locked down. Several of the UI elements do not reflect this by becoming disabled and displaying a lock icon on their left. By the end all the Options pages will work consistently when options are locked down. tdf#157698 (Balázs Varga, allotropia)
    ‎
    - Clarify the options dialog text around macro security settings, to specify exactly what is permitted, and what is prevented. tdf#157588 (Gábor Kelemen, allotropia)
    ‎
    - It is now possible to reset the cropping for an image. tdf#86628 (Andrea Rosetti)
    Accessibility
    - Tree views like the one in the Expert Configuration Dialog (reachable via Tools ▸ Options ▸ LibreOffice ▸ Advanced ▸ Open Expert Configuration) are now correctly exposed via accessibility APIs, so the table content is announced by screen readers. tdf#99609 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - A system setting to reduce/disable animations is now honoured by LibreOffice to disable the "marching ants" animation when copying cells in Calc. (This is new in LibreOffice 24.2 for Windows and Linux; for macOS, this is already included in LibreOffice 7.6.) tdf#155414 (Patrick Luby; Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - Issues in the handling of mouse positions in the Windows-specific accessibility implementation were fixed, so that the NVDA screen reader can announce the text of a Calc cell under the mouse pointer correctly. tdf#156679 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - Various popup menus like the border line style control (e.g. used in Writer: Format ▸ Paragraph ▸ Borders ▸ Line ▸ Style) or the font color chooser (e.g. used in Writer: Format ▸ Character ▸ Font Effect ▸ Font Color) are now correctly announced by the NVDA screen reader on Windows. tdf#101886 tdf#141101 tdf#156561 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - The UNO grid control is now properly exposed to the accessibility layer and can therefore be announced by the NVDA screen reader. tdf#156473 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - The multi line edit (e.g. used in the Help ▸ Check for Updates...) dialog now supports the accessible Text interface, which allows screen readers to announce its text content. tdf#104833 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - An active-descendant-changed accessible events no longer gets incorrectly sent when a combobox value changes without the combobox being focused, which was causing confusing behavior with the NVDA screen reader in the print dialog. tdf#157137 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - On Windows, the IAccessible2 role is now reported for frames, instead of reporting them as dialogs. dd0a0ecb839df1289693d4b2f862e3942a80345d (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - Status bars in dialogs are now reported with the correct accessible role, so screen readers can find and report them accordingly. tdf#157639 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - The content of the Tools ▸ Word Count... dialog is now announced by the NVDA screen reader on Windows when the dialog opens. tdf#157633 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - On Windows, text attributes are now reported on the accessibility layer according to the IAccessible2 text attributes and object attributes specifications, no longer by using custom attribute names and values. Invalid spelling is now also reported via the corresponding text attribute. Together with a corresponding change in version 2024.1 of the NVDA screen reader, this makes announcement of misspelled words work when reading a line of text in Writer. tdf#157696 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - On Windows, text alignment is now reported via the corresponding IAccessible2 object attribute, which makes it possible for assistive technology like the NVDA screen reader to announce it. tdf#135922 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - Checkboxes in the spelling dialog can now be toggled using the space key tdf#135921 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - Writer paragraphs using the "Block Quotation" paragraph style now also use the block quote accessibility role, which makes it possible for screen readers to announce them as block quotes. tdf#135586 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - The VoiceOver screen reader on macOS no longer unhelpfully says "collapsed" when a Writer paragraph or toolbar button receives focus. 64d7bb1917c38ad8e256a482778df647904f5502 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - Toggle buttons can now be toggled using the corresponding accessible action, which e.g. allows screen readers to do so. tdf#112661 tdf#112662 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - The label for row and column headers in Calc is now reported via the "rowindextext" and "colindextext" object attributes as specified in the ARIA specification. The Orca screen reader makes use of these for the announcement of cells. tdf#158030 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - The Orca screen reader on Linux now announces the current status of the underline toolbar button, i.e. it indicates whether underlining is currently active or not. tdf#123864 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    Changes in UI strings
    - Language settings was changed to Languages and Locales in options. tdf#157716 (Aswath T)
    - Decimal separator key was changed to Decimal key on the numpad in options. tdf#113478 (Adoche Onaji)
    - Modify was changed to Assign in Customize dialog. tdf#155214 (Aswath T)
    - Scale was changed to As percentage of the parent in Area dialog tdf#154019. (Heiko Tietze, TDF)
    - Description was changed to Alt Text. tdf#155044 (Heiko Tietze / Ilmari Lauhakangas, TDF)
    - Evaluate up to level was changed to Include up to level in index dialog. tdf#157908 (Seth Chaiklin)
    - Add paragraph and table spacing at tops of pages was changed to Add paragraph and table spacing at top of first page and page breaks in options. tdf#141676 (Seth Chaiklin)
    - AutoUpdate changed to Automatic update from document in the Organize tab of Style dialog. tdf#149796 (Seth Chaiklin)
    - Instead of Widow and Orphan controls, the Text Flow tab of Paragraph Style dialog now talks about paragraph splitting. tdf#156795 tdf#156109 Samuel Mehrbrodt (allotropia)

    Localization
    - LibreOffice is now available in Armenian.
    Armenian is an Indo-European language, spoken by 5–7 million people in the Republic of Armenia and elsewhere in the world. The translation of LibreOffice’s user interface was largely done by Tigran Zargaryan. Read more about this in our blog
    ‎
    Improvements to proofing tools and language support
    Dictionaries
    - Slovenian thesaurus was updated (Martin Srebotnjak, OdprtiTezaver).

    Scripting
    BASIC
    - CCur now respects system locale. tdf#128122 (Jonathan Clark)
    The ScriptForge libraries
    An extensible and robust collection of macro scripting resources for LibreOffice to be invoked from user Basic or Python scripts. (Jean-Pierre Ledure)
    The libraries expose a total of 32 services each with a bunch of methods and properties.
    New in LibreOffice 24.2:
    - The (new) Dataset service helps browsing through the data collected with tables, queries or SQL SELECT statements. Getting and updating records data is made easy with the use of dictionaries field name => field value. Binary fields can be extracted to files or updated with the content of files.
    - The Database service supports the transaction mode with in particular the Commit() and Rollback() methods.
    - Use the new filesystem property of the Document service to navigate through the internal file structure of documents like in usual folders and files.
    - The Files() and Subfolders() methods in the FileSystem service provide the list of files and folders present in a folder. They accept now an additional IncludeSubfolders boolean argument.
    - The UserData property of the Platform service gives access to the content of the equivalent page in the Tools/Options dialog.
    - The Documents service is enriched with a set of functions to manage styles. E.g. suppressing all unused styles can be done in a few lines of code.
    The whole set of services (except when better done by native built-in functions) is made available for Python scripts with identical syntax and behaviour as in Basic.
    The English version of the documentation of the ScriptForge libraries (24.2) is fully integrated in the LibreOffice help pages (https://help.libreoffice.org/24.2/en-US/text/sbasic/shared/03/lib_ScriptForge.html?DbPAR=BASIC). Their translation into other languages is underway. (Alain Romedenne, Rafael Lima)

    Feature Removal / Deprecation
    - Drop Impress/Draw's HTML Export wizard. Exporting to HTML from the UI behaves now the same way as using --convert-to html:"impress_html_Export" from the command line, the slides being exported as a single document. tdf#105303 (Xisco Fauli, TDF)
    - Removed FTP protocol support from LibreOffice, following browser vendors and general industry trends. tdf#146386, 4a26dcac (Michael Stahl, allotropia)
    - The following fonts are no longer bundled by default. tdf#159752 (Khaled Hosny, TDF)
      - NotoMono-Regular.ttf
      - NotoNaskhArabicUI-Bold.ttf
      - NotoNaskhArabicUI-Regular.ttf
      - NotoSans-Condensed.ttf
      - NotoSans-CondensedBold.ttf
      - NotoSans-CondensedBoldItalic.ttf
      - NotoSans-CondensedItalic.ttf
      - NotoSans-Light.ttf
      - NotoSans-LightItalic.ttf
      - NotoSansArabicUI-Bold.ttf
      - NotoSansArabicUI-Regular.ttf
      - NotoSerif-Condensed.ttf
      - NotoSerif-CondensedBold.ttf
      - NotoSerif-CondensedBoldItalic.ttf
      - NotoSerif-CondensedItalic.ttf
      - NotoSerif-Light.ttf
      - NotoSerif-LightItalic.ttf

    Platform Compatibility
    - On Windows, text attributes are now reported on the accessibility layer according to the IAccessible2 text attributes and object attributes specifications, no longer by using custom attribute names and values. Assistive Technology that currently only supports the custom LibreOffice attributes needs to be adapted to support attributes according to the IAccessible2 specifications. For the NVDA screen reader, this has been implemented for the upcoming version 2024.1. tdf#157696
    - The minimum requirements for building and running LibreOffice on Linux have been raised from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7/CentOS 7 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8/CentOS 8 (or equivalent). This also means that Qt 5.15 is the minimum supported Qt version for the Qt 5 based "VCL plugins" (qt5/kf5). 02f48a32

    有助于改进互操作性的新换行算法
    Since 2013, the non-proprietary, metric-compatible alternative fonts are no longer guaranteed the same paragraph layout, because MS Word 2013 and later introduced a new default line breaking algorithm for justified text.
    To fix the lost interoperability, the same algorithm has been implemented in Writer to reduce spaces within justified lines by up to 20%. tdf#119908 blog post (László Németh, donor: NLnet).
    For example, the 2-page test document in Writer has been reduced to one page, just like in MS Word, as visible on the following composite image (red text typeset by MS Word, which covered by the black text typeset by LibreOffice Writer). After the development, the red MS Word text is visible only at high magnification next to the black Writer letters, as the line breaks are already exactly the same:

    Note: used only for DOCX interoperability at the moment (including for ODT files which are converted from new DOCX files with space shrinking), but planned to be the default justification algorithm of the next major versions of LibreOffice.

    - Changes in automatic saving of documents: "Save AutoRecovery information" is turned on by default, as well as "Always create backup copies". Backup copies accumulate in the folder specified by Tools ▸ Options ▸ LibreOffice ▸ Paths. Both settings can be turned off in Tools ▸ Options ▸ Load/Save ▸ General ▸ Save. tdf#152463 (Bogdan Buzea)
    - Fixed many AutoRecovery limitations and re-enabled AutoSave UI. Added "Place backup in same folder as document" option. tdf#65509 tdf#68565 tdf#57414 (Mike Kaganski / Justin Luth, Collabora)
    - Fixed various Notebookbar paper cuts: lots of menu improvements, better print preview support, proper reset of customized layout, better use of radio buttons, less "jumps" back to Home tab, no longer broken after file reload or print preview or master view. tdf#126006 tdf#125504 tdf#122270 tdf#141136 tdf#148121 (Justin Luth)

    筛选器

    基于 Orcus 的筛选器
    The following improvements derive primarily from the 0.19 release of the orcus library (Kohei Yoshida, allotropia).
    - Overhauled the Gnumeric import filter to fix bugs and add missing features. Most notable feature additions are:
      - cell styles
      - rich-text strings
      - named ranges
      - row heights and column widths
      - merged cells
    - Added support for importing rich-text strings in the Excel 2003 XML format.

    从 docx 文档中导入绘图画布 (Drawing Canvas)
    Word has an object called "Drawing Canvas" where you draw shapes on it. They are combined into one object, similar as grouping them. This drawing canvas has to be used in Word, if the drawing contains connector shapes. Word writes this object in two flavors to the file. One is the original drawing canvas in DrawingML markup and the other is a fallback with reduced properties in VML markup. Previous LibreOffice versions could only read the VML fallback. Now the DrawingML is read. That gives you these new import features:
    - The drawing canvas background is imported.
    - Connectors are no longer imported as simple shapes but as true connectors, attached to the start and end shape.
    - Primitive shapes like ellipses are imported as ooxml-shape and thus text inside the shape can wrap now.
    - Shapes can use multicolor gradients, theme colors and glow effects.
    (Regina)

    ODF 加密的改进
    A new mode of password-based ODF encryption has been implemented, with the following advantages:
    - more performant due to deriving a key only once per package
    - more tamper-resistant with authenticated encryption (AES-GCM)
    - better hiding of metadata to reduce information leaks
    - higher resistance to brute forcing using memory-hard Argon2id key derivation function
    Warning:
    You will need LibreOffice 24.2 to open these encrypted files. For this reason, by default the pre-existing standard ODF encryption is used.

    This is available if Experimental Features are enabled in Tools ▸ Options ▸ LibreOffice ▸ Advanced. tdf#105844 (Michael Stahl, allotropia)

    SVG support
    - 24.2.2
      Support for SVG styles parameters: style="overflow:notset", ...:hidden" and ...:visible". (Xisco Fauli, TDF) tdf#159968
    ‎
    - 24.2.3
      Translations stored in <switch> elements are now selected based on the system locale's language tag. (Xisco Fauli, TDF) tdf#160386
    ‎
    - 24.2.4
      Support SVG 2 values context-fill and context-stroke. (Xisco Fauli, TDF) tdf#155651
    ‎

    OOXML SVG 支持
    - Support SVG OOXML extension (http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/drawing/2016/SVG/main namespace)
    - Import the SVG image (svgBlip element) instead of the fallback PNG.
    - Export the SVG image in addition to fallback PNG image, which is used if the svgBlip element is not supported (older MS Office versions). tdf#51510, tdf#126084 (Tomaž Vajngerl, Collabora)
    ‎

    WMF

    - Fix displaying images with size of EOF other than 3. tdf#155887 (Bartosz Kosiorek)

    图形用户界面 (GUI)
    - The Insert Special Characters dropdown now shows a character description for the selected character (and in tooltip on hovering). tdf#156538 (Jim Raykowski)
    ‎
    - The save with password dialog now features a password strength meter that utilizes zxcvbn-c to determine the password strength. tdf#157518 (Sarper Akdemir, allotropia)
    ‎
    - Turn Security Warnings popup windows into infobars to avoid annoying blocker warning dialogs. tdf#157482 (Balázs Varga, allotropia) - In the previous implementation, if the appropriate configuration options are enabled, a warning was issued and/or the personal information have been removed each time the document is saved. These Security Warnings popup windows have been turned into individual infobar warnings at the top of the page. The infobar can be displayed both for hidden and for personal information. In this way, the user receives a hint without significantly disrupting the workflow. A button on the banner could additionally open a dialog in which individual pieces of information can be removed.
    ‎
    - Options dialog pages behaved inconsistently when options are locked down. Several of the UI elements do not reflect this by becoming disabled and displaying a lock icon on their left. By the end all the Options pages will work consistently when options are locked down. tdf#157698 (Balázs Varga, allotropia)
    ‎
    - Clarify the options dialog text around macro security settings, to specify exactly what is permitted, and what is prevented. tdf#157588 (Gábor Kelemen, allotropia)
    ‎
    - It is now possible to reset the cropping for an image. tdf#86628 (Andrea Rosetti)

    可访问性
    - Tree views like the one in the Expert Configuration Dialog (reachable via Tools ▸ Options ▸ LibreOffice ▸ Advanced ▸ Open Expert Configuration) are now correctly exposed via accessibility APIs, so the table content is announced by screen readers. tdf#99609 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - A system setting to reduce/disable animations is now honoured by LibreOffice to disable the "marching ants" animation when copying cells in Calc. (This is new in LibreOffice 24.2 for Windows and Linux; for macOS, this is already included in LibreOffice 7.6.) tdf#155414 (Patrick Luby; Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - Issues in the handling of mouse positions in the Windows-specific accessibility implementation were fixed, so that the NVDA screen reader can announce the text of a Calc cell under the mouse pointer correctly. tdf#156679 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - Various popup menus like the border line style control (e.g. used in Writer: Format ▸ Paragraph ▸ Borders ▸ Line ▸ Style) or the font color chooser (e.g. used in Writer: Format ▸ Character ▸ Font Effect ▸ Font Color) are now correctly announced by the NVDA screen reader on Windows. tdf#101886 tdf#141101 tdf#156561 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - The UNO grid control is now properly exposed to the accessibility layer and can therefore be announced by the NVDA screen reader. tdf#156473 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - The multi line edit (e.g. used in the Help ▸ Check for Updates...) dialog now supports the accessible Text interface, which allows screen readers to announce its text content. tdf#104833 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - An active-descendant-changed accessible events no longer gets incorrectly sent when a combobox value changes without the combobox being focused, which was causing confusing behavior with the NVDA screen reader in the print dialog. tdf#157137 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - On Windows, the IAccessible2 role is now reported for frames, instead of reporting them as dialogs. dd0a0ecb839df1289693d4b2f862e3942a80345d (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - Status bars in dialogs are now reported with the correct accessible role, so screen readers can find and report them accordingly. tdf#157639 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - The content of the Tools ▸ Word Count... dialog is now announced by the NVDA screen reader on Windows when the dialog opens. tdf#157633 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - On Windows, text attributes are now reported on the accessibility layer according to the IAccessible2 text attributes and object attributes specifications, no longer by using custom attribute names and values. Invalid spelling is now also reported via the corresponding text attribute. Together with a corresponding change in version 2024.1 of the NVDA screen reader, this makes announcement of misspelled words work when reading a line of text in Writer. tdf#157696 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - On Windows, text alignment is now reported via the corresponding IAccessible2 object attribute, which makes it possible for assistive technology like the NVDA screen reader to announce it. tdf#135922 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - Checkboxes in the spelling dialog can now be toggled using the space key tdf#135921 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - Writer paragraphs using the "Block Quotation" paragraph style now also use the block quote accessibility role, which makes it possible for screen readers to announce them as block quotes. tdf#135586 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - The VoiceOver screen reader on macOS no longer unhelpfully says "collapsed" when a Writer paragraph or toolbar button receives focus. 64d7bb1917c38ad8e256a482778df647904f5502 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - Toggle buttons can now be toggled using the corresponding accessible action, which e.g. allows screen readers to do so. tdf#112661 tdf#112662 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - The label for row and column headers in Calc is now reported via the "rowindextext" and "colindextext" object attributes as specified in the ARIA specification. The Orca screen reader makes use of these for the announcement of cells. tdf#158030 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)
    - The Orca screen reader on Linux now announces the current status of the underline toolbar button, i.e. it indicates whether underlining is currently active or not. tdf#123864 (Michael Weghorn, TDF)

    用户界面上字符串的变动
    - Language settings was changed to Languages and Locales in options. tdf#157716 (Aswath T)

    - CCur now respects system locale. tdf#128122 (Jonathan Clark)

    ScriptForge 库
    这是一个可扩展的、强健的宏代码资源的集合，可从用户的 Basic 或 Python 宏代码中访问。(Jean-Pierre Ledure)
    这个库对外暴露了总共 32 个服务，每个服务均包含了大量的方法和属性。
    LibreOffice 24.2 新增：
    - The (new) Dataset service helps browsing through the data collected with tables, queries or SQL SELECT statements. Getting and updating records data is made easy with the use of dictionaries field name => field value. Binary fields can be extracted to files or updated with the content of files.
    - The Database service supports the transaction mode with in particular the Commit() and Rollback() methods.
    - Use the new filesystem property of the Document service to navigate through the internal file structure of documents like in usual folders and files.
    - The Files() and Subfolders() methods in the FileSystem service provide the list of files and folders present in a folder. They accept now an additional IncludeSubfolders boolean argument.
    - The UserData property of the Platform service gives access to the content of the equivalent page in the Tools/Options dialog.
    - The Documents service is enriched with a set of functions to manage styles. E.g. suppressing all unused styles can be done in a few lines of code.
    The whole set of services (except when better done by native built-in functions) is made available for Python scripts with identical syntax and behaviour as in Basic.
    The English version of the documentation of the ScriptForge libraries (24.2) is fully integrated in the LibreOffice help pages (https://help.libreoffice.org/24.2/en-US/text/sbasic/shared/03/lib_ScriptForge.html?DbPAR=BASIC). Their translation into other languages is underway. (Alain Romedenne, Rafael Lima)
