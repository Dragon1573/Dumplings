    Writer
    - Added page number wizard in Insert menu for easy one-step insertion of the page number in the header/footer tdf#86630 (Paris Oplopoios / Justin Luth, Collabora)

    - The Paragraph Style dropdown (in the Formatting toolbar) now gradually replaces the default list with styles used in the document rather than always showing the full list at the top. tdf#152666 (Heiko Tietze, TDF)
    - Character properties of the paragraph marker from DOCX are now also remembered in ODT. blog post (Miklos Vajna, Collabora)
    - Citation handling: added plumbing in Writer to build Zotero-like functionality blog post (Miklos Vajna, Collabora)
    - Table of Figures can be generated more flexibly based on a paragraph style, not only by categories or object names. tdf#153090 (Michael Stahl, allotropia)

    - Bibliography entries can now be edited directly from a bibliography table. tdf#72955 (Vojtěch Doležal)
    - Bibliography marks now (by default) hyperlink to matching row in a bibliography table. The click behaviour can be changed to open the "Display URL", open the newly introduced "Target URL", or "None". tdf#153396 (Vojtěch Doležal)

    - Added highlighting for used Paragraph and Character styles and highlighting for used Direct Formatting in text. tdf#38194, tdf#106556 (Jim Raykowski)

    - keyboard navigation through forms: tab key now circularly navigates through content controls/fieldmarks. The modern content controls have a tabIndex field, which allows for precise ordering of keyboard navigation. The tabIndex also allows a control to be skipped - which is useful to avoid getting stuck in rich text controls (since the tab key needs to insert a tab character in that case). Form developers can specify the tabIndex via the content control properties UI. tdf#151548 (Justin Luth, Collabora)

    - New comment indicator scales with zoom, making it more visible at higher zoom factors. tdf#91415 (Heiko Tietze, TDF)

    - The color for the text overflow and comment indicators can now be changed via Tools ▸ Options ▸ LibreOffice ▸ Application Colors (labelled "Text Overflow" and "Comment" respectively), which is also where the text overflow indicator can be turned off (moved from Tools ▸ Options ▸ LibreOffice Calc ▸ View). tdf#154080 (Heiko Tietze, TDF)
    - Pop-up comments now show authorship metadata. (Not visible when all comments are shown, to preserve layout.) tdf#73537 (Balázs Varga, allotropia)

    - Export all page styles in Calc even if they are not in use tdf#154445 (Andreas Heinisch)
    - Automatic hyperlinks now stand out more in Calc tdf#153880 (Balázs Varga, allotropia)

    - Added pivot table compact layout. 2f8d1 (Dennis Francis, Collabora)
    - Add Poisson distribution to Random Number Generators (Sheet ▸ Fill Cells ▸ Fill Random Number...) tdf#154872 (Bartosz Kosiorek)

    - add “formula marker” feature like in Quattro Pro tdf#97551 (feature requested by Brolin Empey in 2016, feature added by Grigory A. Mozhaev in 2023)
    - Fix theme background color lost during XLSX export tdf#91332 (Tünde Tóth, NISZ)
    - If you have enabled the 'Protect Size' option for a shape or form control and you see a different size after reopening the document, please do the following:
      If it is a form control, put the form in 'Design Mode'. This is an icon on the 'Form Controls' toolbar. Then right-click on the shape or form control and open the 'Anchor' item in the context menu. If the anchor is set to 'To cell (resize with cell)', you are affected by the following problem.
      The settings 'Protect size' and anchor 'To cell (resize with cell)' contradict each other. Unfortunately, versions prior to 7.6 had this contradiction written to the file in different ways, so an automatic repair is not possible. Version 7.6 automatically writes the 'To Cell' anchor to the file if the shape or form control is size protected.
      To repair your file, set the anchor type to 'To cell'. Then uncheck the 'Protect Size' option and set the shape to the desired size and position. Now you can re-enable the 'Protect size' option. Then save the file. The shape or form control now has an unchanged size on reopening, not only in version 7.6, but also in older versions.
      Possibly the problem was created because the 'Control Properties' dialog contains an 'Anchor' dropdown field with the entry 'To cell', but this is actually the anchor type 'To cell (resize with cell)'.
      Please excuse that we did not detect the problem earlier.

    Impress & Draw
    - Display soft breaks as line breaks at fontwork. tdf#148000 (Attila Szűcs, Collabora)

    - Added support to open multi image tiff files tdf#155444 (Rashesh Padia, Collabora)
    - Auto fitting text scaling algorithm has been changed so it works similar to MS Office. Text scaling now separates scaling for the spacing scale (paragraph and line spacings) and font scale, where spacing scale can only be 100%, 90% and 80% and font scaling is rounded to the nearest point size. Spacing in the horizontal direction (for example bullet size, various indents) is not scaled anymore. (Tomaž Vajngerl, Collabora)

        - Sidebar theme deck has been adapted to also work
    - Added support for multicolor gradients (Armin Le Grand, allotropia)
    LibreOffice 7.6 has a new feature called "multicolor gradients" (MCGR) implemented by Armin Le Grand. A multicolor gradient still goes from a starting color to final color, but now additional colors are possible in between.
    Although the 'Gradient' tab in the 'Area' dialog has not yet been adapted to the new feature, you can use such gradients. The document File:InfoPresentation MultiColor Gradients LO76.odp lists hints on what you can already do, and the 'Gradient' list in the dialog contains three multicolor gradient examples.

    You can create and modify multicolor gradients using macros, see the 'Gradient2' struct and the associated 'ColorStop' struct in the SDK API reference https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/index.html. Find more details and some primitive example macros in the file File:MacrosForMCGR.odp.
    Since this is a new feature, you might find errors. In this case, please help improve the feature by reporting the issue in our bug tracking system "Bugzilla" https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Bugzilla. When doing so, mention 'MCGR' in the subject line.
    Some notes:
    LibreOffice versions prior to 7.6 cannot interpret multicolor gradients. They will display a gradient made from the first and last color.
    You need to use "1.3 Extended (recommended)" file format. This is the default setting, so don't worry.
    Some gradient properties in ODF (LibreOffice) and OOXML (Microsoft Office) are basically incompatible. This problem is not solved by multicolor gradients.
    - Each view of a document now can have its language specific accelerator manager (Gökay Şatır, Collabora).

    - Documents in the Start Center can now be pinned to show them at the beginning of the recently opened document list. To pin a document, hover the corresponding document and click on the pin icon in the top left corner.

    Scripting
    The ScriptForge libraries
    An extensible and robust collection of macro scripting resources for LibreOffice to be invoked from user Basic or Python scripts. (Jean-Pierre Ledure)
    The libraries expose a total of 31 services each with a bunch of methods and properties.
    New in LibreOffice 7.6:
    - The (new) FormDocument service (a form document is also known as a "Base form", but this is confusing): open (even without first opening the Base document container), close, print, export to PDF, menubar management, access to individual controls.
    - The (new) Toolbar and ToolbarButton services: hide/show built-in or custom toolbars, hide/show individual toolbar buttons, get or set the script or command to execute when clicked.
    - In the Calc service: ranges may be sorted on any number of keys. Also a new RemoveDuplicates method, to clear or to compact ranges, keeping only one copy of identical records.
    - A new Echo method in the Document service to freeze screen updates during scripts or to change the actual mouse pointer.
    - Many improvements on the Dialog and DialogControl services:
      - Support of the Hyperlink control type
      - Dialog controls may be resized. The height and width are expressed in Map AppFont units, like in the Basic IDE.
      - All the On properties (to specify the script to be executed when an event occurs) are now editable.
      - Dialog controls may be created dynamically.
      - Dialog controls may be cloned with the new CloneControl method.
      - A dialog can be created from scratch.
      - Tabulations between controls are defined at once by the new OrderTabs method.
    The whole set of services (except when better done by native built-in functions) is made available for Python scripts with identical syntax and behaviour as in Basic.
    The English version of the documentation of the ScriptForge libraries (7.6) is fully integrated in the LibreOffice help pages (https://help.libreoffice.org/7.6/en-US/text/sbasic/shared/03/lib_ScriptForge.html?DbPAR=BASIC). Their translation into other languages is underway. (Alain Romedenne, Rafael Lima)
    Java
    - The property userClassPath in the javasettings_$OS_$ARCH.xml file now supports (non nested) bootstrap variables (allowing to enter relative paths). 7795a (Samuel Mehrbrodt, allotropia)
    VBA Support
    - Added support for ExportAsFixedFormat VBA function to Export As PDF. tdf#149786 (Balázs Varga, allotropia)

    Feature Removal / Deprecation
    - Option for making PDF the default print job format have been removed and PDF is always used. Support for PostScript as a print job format is deprecated and will be removed in a later release. 2a405 and c3a4f
    - Shortcut visibility setting (for context menus) has been removed from Tools ▸ Options ▸ LibreOffice ▸ View and defaults to the desktop environment's. The expert configuration setting ShortcutsInContextMenus is still available if needed (0 to hide, 1 to show, 2 for default). tdf#152898 (Caolán McNamara, Collabora)
    LOK API
    - Add memory trimming functionality for idle documents (Michael Meeks, Collabora)
    - Avoiding running graphics tests on startup in LOK mode (Michael Meeks, Collabora)
    - Avoid un-necessary slow whole-writer-document off-screen render in some cases (Michael Meeks, Collabora)
    - Swap out compressed graphics in LOK mode as well as de-compressed versions (Michael Meeks, Collabora)
    - Performance improvements for headless cairo rendering, avoiding PDF code-paths (Michael Meeks, Collabora)
    Platform Compatibility
    Mac
    - LibreOffice 7.6 requires macOS 10.15 or newer to run.
    API Changes
    - New Writer UNO command .uno:HighlightCharDF to highlight direct formatting where it is used in the document. (Jim Raykowski) tdf#106556
    - css.qa.XDumper::dump got a kind parameter. 56e17
    - remove .uno:CharBackgroundExt's secondary use to set background color. Instead use .uno:CharBackColor for 7.6+. tdf#85592
    - deprecate .uno:BackColor to set background color in Writer. Instead use the universal .uno:CharBackColor for 7.6+. tdf#85592
    - The C functions rtl_string_newFromStr and rtl_uString_newFromStr, and the C++ constructors for rtl::OString(char const *) and rtl::OUString(sal_Unicode const *) wrapping those functions, no longer support the undocumented behavior of accepting a null pointer string argument and treating it as an empty string. (Such calls had already been diagnosed with std::abort in debug builds since LibreOffice 7.2.) 6028e
    - The Gradient2 struct and the ColorStop struct were added to support multicolor gradients. Search for MCGR to get the related commits. For more about multicolor gradients look at section Core/General.

    - Added highlighting for used Paragraph and Character styles and highlighting for used Direct Formatting in text. tdf#38194, tdf#106556 (Jim Raykowski)

    - keyboard navigation through forms: tab key now circularly navigates through content controls/fieldmarks. The modern content controls have a tabIndex field, which allows for precise ordering of keyboard navigation. The tabIndex also allows a control to be skipped - which is useful to avoid getting stuck in rich text controls (since the tab key needs to insert a tab character in that case). Form developers can specify the tabIndex via the content control properties UI. tdf#151548 (Justin Luth, Collabora)

The old workaround involving editing the default cell style was removed. tdf#89369, commits (Maxim Monastirsky)

    - New comment indicator scales with zoom, making it more visible at higher zoom factors. tdf#91415 (Heiko Tietze, TDF)

    - The color for the text overflow and comment indicators can now be changed via Tools ▸ Options ▸ LibreOffice ▸ Application Colors (labelled "Text Overflow" and "Comment" respectively), which is also where the text overflow indicator can be turned off (moved from Tools ▸ Options ▸ LibreOffice Calc ▸ View). tdf#154080 (Heiko Tietze, TDF)
    - Pop-up comments now show authorship metadata. (Not visible when all comments are shown, to preserve layout.) tdf#73537 (Balázs Varga, allotropia)

    - Export all page styles in Calc even if they are not in use tdf#154445 (Andreas Heinisch)
    - Automatic hyperlinks now stand out more in Calc tdf#153880 (Balázs Varga, allotropia)

    - Added pivot table compact layout. 2f8d1 (Dennis Francis, Collabora)
    - Add Poisson distribution to Random Number Generators (Sheet ▸ Fill Cells ▸ Fill Random Number...) tdf#154872 (Bartosz Kosiorek)

    - Fix theme background color lost during XLSX export tdf#91332 (Tünde Tóth, NISZ)
    - If you have enabled the 'Protect Size' option for a shape or form control and you see a different size after reopening the document, please do the following:
      If it is a form control, put the form in 'Design Mode'. This is an icon on the 'Form Controls' toolbar. Then right-click on the shape or form control and open the 'Anchor' item in the context menu. If the anchor is set to 'To cell (resize with cell)', you are affected by the following problem.
      The settings 'Protect size' and anchor 'To cell (resize with cell)' contradict each other. Unfortunately, versions prior to 7.6 had this contradiction written to the file in different ways, so an automatic repair is not possible. Version 7.6 automatically writes the 'To Cell' anchor to the file if the shape or form control is size protected.
      To repair your file, set the anchor type to 'To cell'. Then uncheck the 'Protect Size' option and set the shape to the desired size and position. Now you can re-enable the 'Protect size' option. Then save the file. The shape or form control now has an unchanged size on reopening, not only in version 7.6, but also in older versions.
      Possibly the problem was created because the 'Control Properties' dialog contains an 'Anchor' dropdown field with the entry 'To cell', but this is actually the anchor type 'To cell (resize with cell)'.
      Please excuse that we did not detect the problem earlier.

    - Auto fitting text scaling algorithm has been changed so it works similar to MS Office. Text scaling now separates scaling for the spacing scale (paragraph and line spacings) and font scale, where spacing scale can only be 100%, 90% and 80% and font scaling is rounded to the nearest point size. Spacing in the horizontal direction (for example bullet size, various indents) is not scaled anymore. (Tomaž Vajngerl, Collabora)

        - Sidebar theme deck has been adapted to also work
    - Added support for multicolor gradients (Armin Le Grand, allotropia)
    LibreOffice 7.6 has a new feature called "multicolor gradients" (MCGR) implemented by Armin Le Grand. A multicolor gradient still goes from a starting color to final color, but now additional colors are possible in between.
    Although the 'Gradient' tab in the 'Area' dialog has not yet been adapted to the new feature, you can use such gradients. The document File:InfoPresentation MultiColor Gradients LO76.odp lists hints on what you can already do, and the 'Gradient' list in the dialog contains three multicolor gradient examples.

    You can create and modify multicolor gradients using macros, see the 'Gradient2' struct and the associated 'ColorStop' struct in the SDK API reference https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/index.html. Find more details and some primitive example macros in the file File:MacrosForMCGR.odp.
    Since this is a new feature, you might find errors. In this case, please help improve the feature by reporting the issue in our bug tracking system "Bugzilla" https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Bugzilla. When doing so, mention 'MCGR' in the subject line.
    Some notes:
    LibreOffice versions prior to 7.6 cannot interpret multicolor gradients. They will display a gradient made from the first and last color.
    You need to use "1.3 Extended (recommended)" file format. This is the default setting, so don't worry.
    Some gradient properties in ODF (LibreOffice) and OOXML (Microsoft Office) are basically incompatible. This problem is not solved by multicolor gradients.
    - Each view of a document now can have its language specific accelerator manager (Gökay Şatır, Collabora).

    GUI
    - The recent documents picklist under File ▸ Recent Documents now shows the 5 most recent module-specific items first. The list can be configured using the ShowCurrentModuleOnly expert option to show only files that can be handled by the current module. tdf#56696 (Andreas Heinisch)

    - Documents in the Start Center can now be pinned to show them at the beginning of the recently opened document list. To pin a document, hover the corresponding document and click on the pin icon in the top left corner. The selected document will then be shown in a separate line at the beginning of the list, along with already pinned documents. tdf#38742 (Andreas Heinisch)

    Scripting
    The ScriptForge libraries
    An extensible and robust collection of macro scripting resources for LibreOffice to be invoked from user Basic or Python scripts. (Jean-Pierre Ledure)
    The libraries expose a total of 31 services each with a bunch of methods and properties.
    New in LibreOffice 7.6:
    - The (new) FormDocument service (a form document is also known as a "Base form", but this is confusing): open (even without first opening the Base document container), close, print, export to PDF, menubar management, access to individual controls.
    - The (new) Toolbar and ToolbarButton services: hide/show built-in or custom toolbars, hide/show individual toolbar buttons, get or set the script or command to execute when clicked.
    - In the Calc service: ranges may be sorted on any number of keys. Also a new RemoveDuplicates method, to clear or to compact ranges, keeping only one copy of identical records.
    - A new Echo method in the Document service to freeze screen updates during scripts or to change the actual mouse pointer.
    - Many improvements on the Dialog and DialogControl services:
      - Support of the Hyperlink control type
      - Dialog controls may be resized. The height and width are expressed in Map AppFont units, like in the Basic IDE.
      - All the On properties (to specify the script to be executed when an event occurs) are now editable.
      - Dialog controls may be created dynamically.
      - Dialog controls may be cloned with the new CloneControl method.
      - A dialog can be created from scratch.
      - Tabulations between controls are defined at once by the new OrderTabs method.
    The whole set of services (except when better done by native built-in functions) is made available for Python scripts with identical syntax and behaviour as in Basic.
    The English version of the documentation of the ScriptForge libraries (7.6) is fully integrated in the LibreOffice help pages (https://help.libreoffice.org/7.6/en-US/text/sbasic/shared/03/lib_ScriptForge.html?DbPAR=BASIC). Their translation into other languages is underway. (Alain Romedenne, Rafael Lima)
    Java
    - The property userClassPath in the javasettings_$OS_$ARCH.xml file now supports (non nested) bootstrap variables (allowing to enter relative paths). 7795a (Samuel Mehrbrodt, allotropia)
    VBA Support
    - Added support for ExportAsFixedFormat VBA function to Export As PDF. tdf#149786 (Balázs Varga, allotropia)

    Feature Removal / Deprecation
    - Option for making PDF the default print job format have been removed and PDF is always used. Support for PostScript as a print job format is deprecated and will be removed in a later release. 2a405 and c3a4f
    - Shortcut visibility setting (for context menus) has been removed from Tools ▸ Options ▸ LibreOffice ▸ View and defaults to the desktop environment's. The expert configuration setting ShortcutsInContextMenus is still available if needed (0 to hide, 1 to show, 2 for default). tdf#152898 (Caolán McNamara, Collabora)
    LOK API
    - Add memory trimming functionality for idle documents (Michael Meeks, Collabora)
    - Avoiding running graphics tests on startup in LOK mode (Michael Meeks, Collabora)
    - Avoid un-necessary slow whole-writer-document off-screen render in some cases (Michael Meeks, Collabora)
    - Swap out compressed graphics in LOK mode as well as de-compressed versions (Michael Meeks, Collabora)
    - Performance improvements for headless cairo rendering, avoiding PDF code-paths (Michael Meeks, Collabora)
    Platform Compatibility
    Mac
    - LibreOffice 7.6 requires macOS 10.15 or newer to run.
    API Changes
    - New Writer UNO command .uno:HighlightCharDF to highlight direct formatting where it is used in the document. (Jim Raykowski) tdf#106556
    - css.qa.XDumper::dump got a kind parameter. 56e17
    - remove .uno:CharBackgroundExt's secondary use to set background color. Instead use .uno:CharBackColor for 7.6+. tdf#85592
    - deprecate .uno:BackColor to set background color in Writer. Instead use the universal .uno:CharBackColor for 7.6+. tdf#85592
    - The C functions rtl_string_newFromStr and rtl_uString_newFromStr, and the C++ constructors for rtl::OString(char const *) and rtl::OUString(sal_Unicode const *) wrapping those functions, no longer support the undocumented behavior of accepting a null pointer string argument and treating it as an empty string. (Such calls had already been diagnosed with std::abort in debug builds since LibreOffice 7.2.) 6028e
    - The Gradient2 struct and the ColorStop struct were added to support multicolor gradients. Search for MCGR to get the related commits. For more about multicolor gradients look at section Core/General.
Version: 7.6.7
RealVersion: 7.6.7.2
