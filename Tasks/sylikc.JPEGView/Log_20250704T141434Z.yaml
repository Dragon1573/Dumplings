    I wanted to make a special thanks to qbnu for coding the new formats support, along with optimizations and improvements to existing formats!
    (Minor version incremented to reflect the many changes between this and the previous release. It's tempting to keep "waiting for the next feature to be done" before releasing...)
    New features:
    - Add support for modern RAW image formats with LibRaw, ex: CR3 (ICC profiles are supported)
      PR #211, thanks qbnu
    - Add basic support for PSD (Adobe Photoshop Document)
      - Color modes supported: Grayscale, RGB, CMYK, Multichannel, Duotone, Lab
      - 8-bit depth PSDs only
      - Compression modes supported: Raw/Uncompressed, RLE
        (See PR for detailed supported/unsupported breakdown)
        PR #233, thanks qbnu
    - Add support for reading EXIF data from JXL, HEIF, AVIF, WebP and PNG files
      PR #213, thanks qbnu
    - Misc EXIF Metadata fixes:
      - GPS info parsed from RAW metadata
      - GPS coordinates in degrees+decimal minutes will now be converted to degrees+minutes+seconds
      - Altitudes below sea level will now show negative
      - Metadata will be shown for either RAW or JPEG, with RAW taking precedence
        PR #211, thanks qbnu
    - RAW metadata's acquisition date shown in window title
      PR #242, thanks qbnu
    - Add multithreading when decoding with libavif and reduced memory usage
      Up to ~20% decoding speed improvement
      PR #204, thanks qbnu
    - Optimize JXL and HEIF RGBA → BGRA conversion
      Speed up ~25% for JXL and ~150% for HEIF
      PR #234, thanks qbnu
    - New INI file setting: WindowBorderlessOnStartup
      On startup, set JPEGView window to borderless mode (title bar hidden)
    - New INI file setting: WindowAlwaysOnTopOnStartup
      On startup, set JPEGView window to be always on top
    Bugs fixed:
    - Adjust animation frame times to appear closer to their actual values
      Accounts for time spent processing frame. (Minimum frame time is 10ms due to technical limitations)
      PR #205, thanks qbnu
      Changed behavior:
    - INI Option: UseEmbeddedColorProfiles=true can be used without losing Animated PNG support
      ICC profiles are not supported for Animated PNG
      PR #202, thanks qbnu
    - Renamed INI Option: OverrideOriginalFileWithoutSaveDialog → OverwriteOriginalFileWithoutSaveDialog
    - Renamed INI Option: TrimWithoutPromptLosslessJPEG → CropWithoutPromptLosslessJPEG
