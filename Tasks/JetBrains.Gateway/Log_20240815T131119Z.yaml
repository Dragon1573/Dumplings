    The Gateway 2024.2 is out with the following updates:
    - The scaling for tool windows after reconnecting to a project, including those on LUX, now works as expected.
    - Better JCEF support: The built-in preview for HTML files and preview support for SVG files have been improved.
    - We have increased the number of settings that are now synchronized between the fronted and the remote backend.
    - Settings are now properly managed on the frontend side, and all the backend and frontend directories' paths have been updated.
    - Reverse port forwarding (from the local machine to the remote backend) is now supported.
    - Launching the IDE backend is now also available for various images and operating systems, such as Debian, Fedora, OpenJDK, and more.
    - We've improved the performance of the reconnection process.
    For more details, please refer to the release notes.
