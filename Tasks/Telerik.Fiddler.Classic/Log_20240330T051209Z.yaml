     Show informational banners in cases where some functionalities are not supported
     Add tls1.1 and tls1.2 in the default HTTPS supported protocols for decryption (for new installations only)

    fixes:
     Changing fonts breaks the TextView tab by hiding the search option
     Saving SAZ file fails when there are more than 62K sessions
     Check for update fails when tls1.2 is not added in the HTTPS supported protocols
     Host Remapping tool fails to override certificate behavior for requests created by Fiddler Classic
     Export as cURL uses -d instead of --data-raw which causes security issues in some rare cases
     An unnecessary log is printed when ClientHello's length is greater than 255 bytes
