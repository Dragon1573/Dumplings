    Two new settings can now be changed in the Spirometry settings dialog:
    - Users can select flow units which can be selected as either uL/s, mL/s or L/s.Â  This is useful for work with smaller animals.
    - Users can now apply a noise floor clamp to the selected flow channel that can be used to remove small positive or negative offsets in the flow signal.
