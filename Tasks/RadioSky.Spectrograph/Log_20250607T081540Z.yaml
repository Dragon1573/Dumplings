    This is an optional update

    This update fixes a number of bugs, especially
    in the drawing routines.

    ********Magnifier**********
    A magnifier option has been added and is available
    under the View menu item. If you use this option,
    it may request that you install the dot Net platform.
    Most will probably have this. If for any reason
    you wish not to install dot Net, don't use it.
    To configure the magnifier, right click on it.
    To capture a magnified image, point to it and
    type Alt+X to freeze the image, then right click
    on the image and select Save to a file or the
    Clipboard. Press Alt-X again to unfreeze. The
    magnifier is a seperate application and can be
    used without RSS.
