    - Support for ML-KEM, the NIST-standardised post-quantum key exchange mechanism. (In addition to NTRU Prime, which has been supported since 0.78.)
    - Support for full Unicode file names in Windows file selector dialogs. (However, these do not yet round-trip through a saved session.)
    - Bug fix: psftp -b works again.
    - Bug fix: assertion failure if an SSH connection times out at the login prompt.
    - Bug fix: crash in Pageant if an SSH connection is abandoned while waiting for a deferred decryption passphrase.
    - Bug fix: tight loop if PuTTY tried to send an empty answerback string.
    - Bug fix: accidental truncation of some configuration edit boxes' contents to 127 characters.
    - Bug fix: Windows XP support was accidentally broken, and now reinstated.
    - Bug fix: restored interoperation with third-party tools that auto-fill login prompts by sending ^M for Return.
    - Bug fix: confusion when terminal window resized by tools like FancyZones.
    - Bug fix: the small keypad keys didn't reliably work in the terminal on Unix.
