    - Major refactoring of Unicode handling to allow the use of 'foreign' Unicode characters, i.e. outside the system's configured default character set / code page. Not yet complete, but the following things work:
      - Windows console: usernames and passwords entered interactively into PSCP, PSFTP and Plink can use foreign characters.
      - Windows command line: usernames, remote commands, and filenames entered via command-line options can use foreign characters.
      - PuTTY's own terminal (on Windows and Unix): even if it's not configured into UTF-8 mode for the main session, interactive usernames and passwords can use foreign characters.
    - Unicode version update: all character analysis is updated to Unicode 16.0.0.
    - Unicode terminal rendering: national and regional flags are now understood by PuTTY's terminal emulator. (However, correct display of those flags will depend on fonts and operating system.)
    - The Event Log mentions the local address and port number of the outgoing connection socket.
    - Bracketed paste mode can now be turned off in the Terminal > Features panel.
    - Unix Pageant: new --foreground mode for running as a subprocess.
    - Bug fix: the 'border width' configuration option is now honoured even when the window is maximised.
    - Bug fix: SHA-2 based RSA signatures are now sent with correct zero padding.
    - Bug fix: terminal wrap mishandling caused occasional incorrect redraws in curses-based applications.
    - Bug fix: Alt + function key in "Xterm 216+" mode sent a spurious extra escape character.
