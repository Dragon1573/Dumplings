    Introducing the unsafe protocol warning
    8x8 Work for Desktop now shows a warning pop-up that alerts users when an unsafe protocol is used to display caller details. Although this pop-up feature is beneficial, an unsafe protocol can potentially compromise the user's computer by accessing the command utility and executing arbitrary commands.
    Notes:
    - All protocols that do not start with ‘http:’, ‘https:’ or ‘mailito’ are considered unsafe.
    - To avoid any security vulnerability, enter only commands approved by your IT administrator in your pop-up.

    To learn more about caller info pop-ups, see View caller info pop-up.

    Ability to disable startup pop-ups by IT admins
    IT administrators can disable startup pop-ups in the 8x8work-config.json configuration file to avoid disruptive startup pop-ups upon opening 8x8 Work for Desktop. This feature benefits customers who engage in remote sessions and frequently clear their user cache.
    The IT admins can now disable the following startup pop-ups at the specified locations using the indicated config keys:
    {
    “app-disable0aauto-showing-product-tour”: true,
    “App-disable-sus-popup”: true,
    “App-disable-voicemil-greeting-recordiong-popup”; true,
    “App-disable-new-audio-saource-popup”: true
    }
    To learn more about setting system requirements by IT admins, see About system requirements.

    Enhanced experience for typing into the dial pad
    You can now type extension numbers into the dial-pad without formatting interruptions, ensuring precise input.

    Ability to mask macro values in the caller info pop-up by IT admins
    Admins can now hide the macro values i the caller info pop-up. Only the value of the query parameter called param will be encoded with base64. This feature returns an encoded base64 response for the provided URL.
    The admins can set the new configuration for a specific user via the 8x8work-config.json file and for all users through the 8x8 Admin Console’s Work Apps Settings page.
    Note: Users cannot change the caller info pop-up value/URL when this configuration is set up.
    The example below demonstrates this configuration and its outcome:

    Improved display of phone number used by multiple contacts in active call user interface and call history
    To eliminate confusion about the contact name displayed for a phone number used by multiple contacts, the active call interface and call history will only show the phone number, similar to the current practice with the incoming call banner.
    To learn more about call logs, see Access call history.

    Other enhancements
    - Improved accessibility for Screen Readers in areas like Calls, Contacts, and Call controls.
    - Web Dialer is officially supported in Firefox. To learn how to install the 8x8 Web Dialer Firefox Extension, see Install the 8x8 Web Dialer Firefox Extension.

    To learn how to set up a specific speaker for incoming ringtones, see Set up a secondary ring source.
