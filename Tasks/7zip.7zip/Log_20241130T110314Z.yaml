    - The default dictionary size values for LZMA/LZMA2 compression methods were increased:
    dictionary size   compression level
      v24.08  v24.09  v24.09
              32-bit  64-bit
        8 MB   16 MB   16 MB   -mx4
       16 MB   32 MB   32 MB   -mx5 : Normal
       32 MB   64 MB   64 MB   -mx6
       32 MB   64 MB  128 MB   -mx7 : Maximum
       64 MB   64 MB  256 MB   -mx8
       64 MB   64 MB  256 MB   -mx9 : Ultra
    The default dictionary size values for 32-bit versions of LZMA/LZMA2 don't exceed 64 MB.
    - 7-Zip now can calculate the following hash checksums: SHA-512, SHA-384, SHA3-256 and MD5.
    - APM and HFS support was improved.
    - If an archive update operation uses a temporary archive folder and the archive is moved to the destination folder, 7-Zip shows the progress of moving the archive file, as this operation can take a long time if the archive is large.
    - The bug was fixed: 7-Zip File Manager didn't propagate Zone.Identifier stream for extacted files from nested archives (if there is open archive inside another open archive).
    - Some bugs were fixed.
