    Added
    - Winch's implementation of the SIMD proposal for WebAssembly is now feature-complete (but still being fuzzed). #10180 #10170 #10203 #10202 #10210 #10213 #10224 #10205 #10226 #10228 #10236 #10241 #10243 #10247 #10271 #10284 #10288 #10296
    - The pytorch implementation in wasmtime-wasi-nn now has GPU support. #10204
    - Cranelift now supports emitting the AArch64 extr instruction. #10229
    - Cranelift now supports emitting the x64 shld instruction. #10233
    - Initial support for the stack-switching proposal has started to land, but it is not complete just yet. #10251 #10265 #10255
    Changed
    - Pulley's implementation of loads/stores to linear memory has changed to better support optimizations and reduction of interpreter opcodes in the final binary. #10154
    - Cranelift's verifier now ensures that integers used as address types have the correct width. #10209
    - Wasmtime and Cranelift's minimum supported version of Rust is now 1.83.0. #10264
    - Wasmtime now mentions the filename when the input cannot be opened on the CLI. #10292
    - All types are now generated in component::bindgen!, even if they're not reachable. #10311
    - Tables allocated with the system allocator now use alloc_zeroed (aka calloc) for allocation. #10313
    Fixed
    - GC: the is-null-or-i31ref checks have been fixed. #10221
    - GC: an incorrect assertion and canonicalized types for runtime usage has been fixed. #10223
    - GC: subtype checks for imported globals during instantiation have been fixed. #10304
    - GC: exposing references to wasm in the gc_alloc_raw libcall has been fixed. #10322
    - Winch's fuel checks correctly sync fuel before the check now. #10231
    - Winch's treatment of stores and other trapping ops has been fixed on AArch64. #10201
    - Winch's handling of the shadow stack pointer has been fixed on AArch64. #10263
    - Winch's handling of address calculations has been fixed on AArch64. #10297
    - Winch's handling of multivalue return of constants has ben fixed. #10315
