    The major feature of this release is that the WASI support in Wasmtime is now considered stable and flagged at an 0.2.0 version approved by the WASI subgroup. The release was delayed a few days to hold off until the WASI subgroup voted to approve the CLI and HTTP worlds and they're now on-by-default! Additionally the component model is now enabled by default in Wasmtime, for example an opt-in flag is no longer required on the CLI. Note that embeddings still must opt-in to using the component model by using the wasmtime::component module.
