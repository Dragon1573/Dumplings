    - Wasmtime now supports DWARF Fission *.dwp files. #8055

    - A Config knob is now available for one-entry call_indirect caching to speed up modules with lots of call_indirect instructions. #8509
    - Cranelift's riscv64 backend has initial support for the Zfa Extension. #8536

    Changed
    - Support for NaN canonicalization on x64 has been optimized to avoid branches. #8313
    - The bindgen! macro now defaults to assuming imports cannot trap, but this behavior is configurable at macro-generation time. #8310
    - The fd_{read,write} implementations in wasmtime-wasi have been optimized. #8303
    - The wasmtime-wasi-http crate has been refactored and has improved documentation. #8332 #8347
    - Unused with parameters in bindgen! now generate an error. #8371
    - The fd_read implementation in wasmtime-wasi now only reads into a single iovec per call. #8415
    - The wasmtime_val_t type in the C API no longer holds any allocations. This type must still be manually managed to properly unroot values, however. #8451
    - Add an optimized "sleep" path for poll_oneoff to wasmtime-wasi. #8429
    - The Wasmtime-internal wasmtime-runtime crate has been removed. #8501
    - The pooling allocator now allows twice as many elements as before. #8527
    - Using CMake to build the C API has been improved along a number of axes. #8490 #8497 #8549
    Fixed
    - Pooling allocator CLI options are now respected with the wasmtime serve subcommand. #8525
