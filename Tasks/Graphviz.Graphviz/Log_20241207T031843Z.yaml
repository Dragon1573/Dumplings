    Added
    - Support for building the SWIG-generated R language bindings has been integrated into the CMake build system. This is controllable by the -DENABLE_R={AUTO|ON|OFF} option.
    - A sandboxing wrapper, dot_sandbox, is now included with Graphviz. Users should prefer their platform’s native security solutions, but if nothing better is available this wrapper offers safe processing of untrusted inputs in some scenarios.
    Changed
    - JPEG images without an APP0 leading segment are supported for use in src fields and friends. Previously Graphviz was overly strict with the types of JPEGs it would recognize. #2619
    Fixed
    - The GVPR library program depath no longer acts on previously deleted nodes, causing unpredictable results. #1702
    - Void-typed function parameters (int foo(void bar)) and variables void baz; in GVPR are gracefully rejected. #2585
    - Input that induce a set node height but no set node width no longer crash with the failure “Assertion failed: (r->boundary[i] <= r->boundary[NUMDIMS + i]), function RTreeInsert”. It is typically not obvious to users when their input falls into this situation, hence why the assertion message is quoted here. This was a regression in Graphviz 12.0.0. #2613
    - Strings containing double quote characters preceded by escape sequences (e.g. \n") are once again correctly escaped in dot or canonical output. This was a regression in Graphviz 9.0.0. #2614
    - dot_builtins no longer lists duplicate format options in its error messages. #2604
    - A precision error that resulted in truncated edge lines has been corrected. This was a regression in Graphviz 12.0.0. #2620
    - The xlib plugin (-Tx11) resets its initialization state during finalization. This fixes a rare scenario where multiple input graphs are supplied and initialization for one of the not-first graphs fails. In this scenario, finalization would be unaware of this failure and act on invalid state.
