    Changed
    - In the Autotools build system, the rsvg plugin is no longer built when pangocairo is missing. Previously, when librsvg was found but pangocairo was not, this plugin would be enabled and built but offer no functionality.
    - The RSVG plugin now requires librsvg â‰¥ 2.42.7.
    - The RSVG plugin uses newer librsvg APIs where available. #2206
    Fixed
    - In the Autotools build system, fallback discovery of libANN when pkg-config support is unavailable has been corrected to properly enable use of libANN. This primarily affects mingle users on Debian-based operating systems or macOS.
    - The RSVG plugin no longer dereferences a null pointer when failing to create new RSVG handles.
    - The Pango plugin no longer assumes a little endian environment when loading PS images.
