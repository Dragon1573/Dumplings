    Changed
    - When using the CMake build system, the minimum required version of CMake has been upgraded 3.14.1 â†’ 3.21.
    - Building Graphviz from source now requires a C compiler with ISO C17 support.
    - Processing a graph with GVPR now makes explicit the default "\N" label for nodes.
    Fixed
    - Graphs with large weights no longer trigger double frees. #1494, #2331
    - nop preserves empty string labels. #2436
    - The order of programmatic calls to gvContext/gvContextPlugin and agmemread no longer affects default node labels. #2434
    - Adjacency matrices are sparse and expanded on demand, removing out-of-bounds accesses when computing these for some graphs. #1472
