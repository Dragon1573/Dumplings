    Changed
    - When built with PangoCairo, the Kitty plugin is now available in Graphviz static builds. Previously it was only available in shared library (on-demand plugin loading) builds.
    - The distributed Fedora and Rocky Linux packages now include the Kitty plugin. #2704
    - On Windows, the GDI+ plugin is now available in Graphviz static builds. Previously it was only available in shared library (on-demand plugin loading) builds.
    - Processing a graph with GVPR no longer makes explicit the default "\N" label for nodes. This undoes a change from Graphviz 13.0.1. #2705
    - nop no longer preserves empty string labels. This undoes a change from Graphviz 13.0.1. #2436, #2705
    - The order of programmatic calls to gvContext/gvContextPlugin and agmemread once again affects default node labels. This undoes a change from Graphviz 13.0.1. #2434, #2705
    Fixed
    - Spline routing can now deal with horizontal and vertical lines. This removes some instances of the “Something is probably seriously wrong” warning. #241
    - Using layerselect beyond layer 1 no longer causes crashes. #1648
    - Correct parsing of a PDF file’s /MediaBox section no longer depends on the internal BUFSIZ constant.
    - Round tripping a graph through a file no longer causes it to acquire a default node label \N. #2705
