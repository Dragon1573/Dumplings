    Benchmarks
    - CINEBENCH 2024 for CPU
    - y-cruncher
      - Supports versions 0.8.3, 0.8.4 and 0.8.5
      - BenchMate is bundled now with version 0.8.5 with Zen 5 optimization and the new Pi-BBP workload
      - New CPU-heavy, easy on RAM benchmark Pi-BBP with the categories: 1B, 10B and 100B
      - Improved result validation of all categories by parsing and evaluating the validation file
    Features & Improvements
    - Improved HWBOT screenshot upload by automatically reducing the resulting screenshot size to a lower resolution to keep them below 2 MB. This will add CPU load to the capture process, so you will see a warning before this is really done.
    - Added screenshot quality and size limit to the options dialog to give users the knobs to optimize their screenshots and circumvent the automatic behaviour
    - Improved result dialog location to adhere to various taskbar settings (autohide, different position)
    - Missing motherboard information will not produce invalid results anymore (can happen with OEM motherboards)
    - Improved HWBOT submission error handling (CPU/GPU not found in database will not be rejected anymore)
    - Improved handling of failed installation validation on startup with automatic update of root certificates
    - Added architecture detection for Intel Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, Lunar Lake, Zen 4, Zen 5
    - Added codenames to architecture detection for AMD Zen (shown in result dialog)
    - Detect and support Zhaoxin and Centaur CPUs
    - Update to HWiNFO 8.05: support for Granite Ridge (Zen 5), improved support for Threadripper 7000 series and 14900KS
    - Updated tools: CPU-Z 2.1.0.0 (2.10), GPU-Z 2.59, HWiNFO 8.05
    Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug that sets the wrong result time leading to incorrect sorting of entries in the result list
    - Fixed a possible app crash when the result dialog is closed with ESC during screenshots are taken and encoded
    - Fixed a bug in the ACPI PM Timer implementation that prevented to launch BenchMate
