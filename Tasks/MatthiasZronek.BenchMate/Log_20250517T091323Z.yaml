    Features & Improvements
    - Improved User Interface trying to get a cleaner look
      - Main window can be resized and maximized
      - Sorting of the result list is now possible by clicking on the column headers
      - New Status Bar for loading, warning and error states
      - Support for docking of child windows (ColdbugMate, Debug Log, Analyze Results)
      - Windows will now remember the last position, docking state, size and visibility
    - 7-Zip:
      - Added Thread Count option to CLI wrapper (thanks to Bastiaan_NL)
      - Added Timer resolution option to CLI wrapper
      - Fixed a bug that reported an error in BenchMate when a run was aborted
    - Any errors in benchmarks will immediately show a Windows notification (make sure you are allowing them)
    - It's no longer necessary to install BenchMate in the Program Files folder to launch successfully
    - HWiNFO in 64 bit is now launched in a new unmanaged mode. The app will not be listed in the process list, there are no affinity or process priority settings and it is not guarded by BenchMate at all. This was a necessary step to avoid that BenchMate only works in the Program Files folder.
    - Improved error messages for users in case the CLI Wrapper can not load the benchmark (benchmark's version not supported, files invalid, ...)
    - Validation of GPU vendor and model is more forgiving to allow latest (integrated) GPUs that are not properly detected
    - Windows 11 24H2 and Windows Server 2025 is now correctly detected
    - Added support for AMD Threadripper 9000 series (Shimada Peak)
    - Added detection for AMD Strix Point, Fire Range, Shimada Peak, Turin and Intel Panther Lake
    - Added detection for some legacy CPUs like Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III and several Core architectures
    - Updated tools: HWiNFO 8.26, GPU-Z 2.65.1, CPU-Z 2.15
    Bugfixes
    - y-cruncher 0.8.5:
      - hotfix for detecting invalid scores determined by y-cruncher's spot check
      - shows the progress of the benchmark again (summing percentages)
    - CINEBENCH R20/R23, GPUPI, all CLI benchmarks:
      - process errors in run initialization phase will now be properly reported
    - Unknown Windows versions will be marked correctly as unknown in the result dialog
    - Fixed Bug Reporter, reports will now correctly be sent to bugs.benchmate.org again
