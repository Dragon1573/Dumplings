    Notable Changes in Igor Pro 9.05
    IGOR APPLICATION
    BUG FIXES
    - Fixed LoadData using an invalid wave name when loading a large wave with a long wave name.
    - Fixed a bug in which copying a large amount of data to the clipboard could cause Igor to quit (after giving the user a chance to save the experiment).
    - Fixed a wave assignment bug when run on the command line while leaving some indices unspecified. For example, a wave assignment to a 3D wave where only the row and column were specified.
    - Igor Tex now correctly displays an expression that starts with a superscript or subscript such as:
      TextBox/C/N=text0 "\\$WMTEX$ ^{3}\\Delta_{u} \\$/WMTEX$"
    PROCEDURES
    New Polar Graphs package:
    - Fixed problems introduced in 9.04 that rendered the New Polar Graph panel non-functional. Improved behavior of valueAtCenter for negative radii.
