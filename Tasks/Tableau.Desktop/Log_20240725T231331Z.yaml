    W-16057563 When tried to connect the Salesforce Org to Tableau we are not able to see the all Objects which get introduced after Summer '23 in dashboard.
    Tableau cannot access any entity introduced after 242 (Spring '23, Api Version 57.0). Fundraising entities are not visible until API 59.0 because they were not introduced until 246.
    W-15578455 When a subscription is sent to a subscriber, the image and pdf of the viz does not display marks correctly for a number of sheets of the dashboard. The same sheets render properly on Tableau Desktop and Tableau Cloud/Server on both client and server render. The individual sheet itself when subscribed loads without issue and changing, removing, or moving the impacted sheets renders the sheets differently (sometimes normal and sometimes blank.
    W-15156128 Flows Start to Fail with Error ""No Such Column"".
    Issue happens on Tableau Cloud and Tableau Prep Builder 2024.1.0.
    It does not happen in Prep Builder 2023.3.3 or before.
    W-15713115 Views connected to Snowflake shared databases do not load but the error message ""TableauException: SQL execution error: Creating table on shared database 'PROD_DB_PPL' is not allowed."" is presented in Tableau Desktop/Server 2023.1 and later versions.
