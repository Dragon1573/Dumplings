    All platforms
    - New: The --reason flag is added to the tailscale down command.
    - New: ReconnectAfter policy setting, which configures the maximum period of time between a user disconnecting Tailscale and the client automatically reconnecting.
    - Changed: Tailscale CLI commands throw an error if multiple of the same flag are detected.
    - Fixed: Network connectivity issues when creating a new profile or switching profiles while using an exit node.
    Linux
    - Fixed: DNS-over-TCP fallback works correctly with upstream servers reachable only via the tailnet.
    Windows
    - New: AlwaysOn.Enabled and AlwaysOn.OverrideWithReason policy settings, which enable and configure a Tailscale client mode where the client stays connected at all times, unless an exception applies.
    - New: When Always On mode is enabled, Tailscale connects as soon as a user signs in to the device and stays connected, regardless of whether the GUI is running. This enables access to tailnet resources, such as network-mapped drives, earlier in the sign-in process, and can also be used on headless Windows environments.
    - New: EnableDNSRegistration policy setting, which configures whether Tailscale IP addresses should be registered with Active Directory DNS.
    - New: The Tailscale GUI starts for all signed-in users when the client is installed.
    - Fixed: DNS-over-TCP fallback works correctly with upstream servers reachable only via the tailnet.
    - Fixed: Issue where the Tailscale GUI would not start if the client was installed via Group Policy or mobile device management (MDM) while a user was already signed in.
    - Fixed: Issue where the Tailscale GUI did not auto-start after a client update.
    macOS
    - New: AlwaysOn.Enabled and AlwaysOn.OverrideWithReason policy settings, which enable and configure a Tailscale client mode where the client stays connected at all times, unless an exception applies.
    - Changed: ForceEnabled policy setting is deprecated in favor of the AlwaysOn policy setting.
    - Fixed: DNS-over-TCP fallback works correctly with upstream servers reachable only via the tailnet.
    - Fixed: Tailscale automatically recreates and/or reactivates its VPN configuration on start.
