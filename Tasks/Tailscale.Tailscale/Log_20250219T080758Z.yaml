    All platforms
    - Fixed: Nodes could lose the display names of owners of peers in rare cases. This had manifested in missing names in tailscale status and could prevent incoming Tailscale SSH connections from being accepted. The behavior is reverted to that of v1.78.x and earlier.
    Linux
    - Fixed: SSH clients that skip the none auth method and immediately try publickey can connect to Tailscale SSH as expected. The behavior is reverted to that of v1.78.x and earlier.
    macOS
