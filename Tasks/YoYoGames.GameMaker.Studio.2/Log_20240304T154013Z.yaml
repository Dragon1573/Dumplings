    2024.2 brings a lot of bug fixes and performance improvements already (especially in-game, but also a number of stability and project-loading fixes in the IDE). In terms of new features and notable changes, you will also find: Projects are now saved/loaded in a new format and there have been multiple changes to sort entries in a predicatable manner and avoid source control conflicts; Sequences now have audio effect tracks, so you can manipulate the audio in your Sequences over time; the code editor and compiler will now better catch functions which have not had all required arguments provided; #macro definitions now support inheritance (as was always implied by the IDE using a tree for the configs editor); Tilemaps are now compressed in your rooms; Static functions now have non-anonymous names to help with debugging issues, the in-game debug UI dialogs have had a number of fixes/additions and there have been various fixes to the Debugger inside the IDE; there is a new gml_pragma() option "optimise" for HTML5 games to turn on/off further JS optimisations; a new Gaussian Blur filter has been added for you to use in your games; fixed that borderless games would still resize themselves when using async dialogs, despite not being exclusive fullscreen; fixed issues with building Extensions on case-sensitive operating systems; and there have been a number of tweaks and improvements for the in-IDE bug reporting tool so it's even smoother and easier to send us a report when issues do occur.
    Be aware that due to the changes in project format, 2024 IDEs will no longer allow you to set 2023-and-older runtimes as active and they will not appear in the table in Preferences > Runtime Feeds. Projects created/edited in 2024 IDEs can generally be used in older IDEs, so that's not a problem, but if you need to use older runtimes to create or build your projects then you need to use the matching older IDE also.
