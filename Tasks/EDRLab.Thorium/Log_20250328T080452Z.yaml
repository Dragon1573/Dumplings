    Summary
    Version 3.1.0 was released on 17 February 2025.

    LINUX USERS (Ubuntu in particular): you will need to run the shell command sudo chmod 4755 /opt/Thorium/chrome-sandbox in a terminal session after installing the Debian package. Unfortunately this is a known issue with Electron: https://github.com/edrlab/thorium-reader/issues/2519#issuecomment-2629328005

    This release includes the following (notable) new features, improvements and bug fixes:
    - Localization: updated translations, Weblate now recommended instead of GitLocalize
    - Feature: annotations, import + export (various "selector" formats powered by Apache Annotator, tested with DOM Ranges spanning across XHTML, SVG, MathML, foreignObject, etc.) and updated graphical user interface (list filtering, etc.)
    - Feature: TTS readaloud and EPUB3 Media Overlays, option to disable continuous playback (checkbox in playback settings panel)
    - Feature: visual navigation indicators in HTML publication documents (temporary outline) can now be disabled
    - Feature: additional information labels in the "settings" GUI to describe actions and choices
    - Feature: URL query params 'lang' and 'version' to online documentation
    - Feature: TTS readium-speech integration, organised and opinionated voice selector
    - Feature: TTS and EPUB3 Media Overlays, popup foonotes are disabled so that they can be played inline as intended by content creators
    - Feature: "preferred" settings for reader configuration, save/load/reset
    - Feature: PDF.js latest library version
    - Feature: latest Electron v34 (i.e. more recent Chromium web browser engine and NodeJS runtime)
    - Fix: XML parsing in DAISY 2.02 NCC.html was choking on doctype with empty declaration [], also SMIL parser fix for skippables (system-required sidebar-on and note-on), and merge of contiguous SMIL SEQ/AUDIO inside PAR
    - Fix: XML parser UTF8 BOM Byte Order Mark removal
    - Fix: TTS readaloud SVG deep utterances (no aria-label / title), escapability
    - Fix: TTS Japanese Ruby skipped (ignored) when visually hidden, played instead of base / non-Ruby when visually displayed (does not use skippability semantics of TTS / EPUB3 Media Overlays)
    - Fix: accessibility labels in some user interface controls, improved GUI structure and semantics
    - Fix: accessibility metadata, preliminary update (more to come in a future release) to match the latest presentation guide, support for printPageNumbers vs. pageBreakMarkers vs. pageNavigation
    - Fix: download panel was reporting incorrect status (mismatched unique identification), URL was conflated with label, added support for unknown content-length (indeterminate progress bar), handling of content-disposition UTF8 percent-escaped filename, consume www-authenticate response error description, HTTP content-type was taking the precedence over content-disposition header
    - Fix: LCP provider certificate expiration error messaging
    - Fix: bookmarks were incorrectly synchronised when several reader windows were open
    - Fix: OPDS and other publication download authentication flow across domains, also fixed OAuth 2.0 Implicit Grant flow (client ID etc.)
    - Fix: added missing keyboard shortcuts in library view for first/last previous/next
    - Fix: keyboard focus "inversion of control" (eliminated focus stealing), Thorium GUI now pushes requests to navigator / HTML document renderer, removed body-injected underscore / jump link, automatic vs. manual keyboard redirection from modal vs. docked navigation panels, added keyboard shortcut to force-focus deep into the webview (just in case the default method fails, depends on Chromium behaviour of out-of-process iframe inside shadow DOM / custom element)
    - Fix: command line lifecycle / action flow
    - Fix: various GUI issues
    - Fix(dev): updated Continuous Integration / GitHub Actions scripts, added dependency analyser script, introduced support for Flox/Nix, improved Linux Docker builder, adde NPM scripts lifecycle checks (pre/post/install security)
    - Fix: Thorium was only accepting lower case file extensions
    - Fix: LCP edge-case,broken publications that are encrypted but do not contain a license to unlock them
    - Fix: Divina layout setting was not enabled, improved progression reporting
    - Fix: user interface finger touch / swipe, text selection
    - Fix: persistent JSON filesystem state diff/patch could crash with large dataset
    - Fix: improved performance of text selection highlighter engine
