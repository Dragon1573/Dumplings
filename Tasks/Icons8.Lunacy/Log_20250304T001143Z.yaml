    Advanced prototyping
    We added new triggers and animations, so you can now create more complex prototypes. See the full details in the updated Prototyping guide.
    New font picker
    We redesigned the font picker to make working with fonts easier. Now you can:
    - Mark fonts as favorites for quick access.
    - Filter fonts by Google Fonts, document fonts, or favorites.
    - Filter by language (multiselect).
    - Show only monospaced fonts.
    Deep unlock
    Quickly unlock all locked layers within a selection using Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Alt+L shortcut. You can also use the Deep Unlock Selection command from the Layer menu or on the context menu search.
    Deep detach
    In a similar manner, you can quickly detach all nested instances with the Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Alt+B shortcut, or use the Deep Detach Instances command from the context menu.

    TIFF Support
