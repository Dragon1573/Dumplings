    The following is a list of improvements made between the April 2025 release and the May 2025 update.
    Starting with the May 2025 release, JAWS, ZoomText, and Fusion now supports Home and Professional subscription licenses. Please contact Freedom Scientific sales or your local distributor for more information.
    MathCAT Now the Default for Reading Math Content
    JAWS now uses MathCAT by default for reading math content. MathCAT improves how math is spoken and displayed in Braille, making it faster, clearer, and more customizable for you.
    Since its introduction as an Early Adopter Program feature, we have continued to enhance MathCAT support by adding:
    - A new Math group in Settings Center for customizing various math related options for speech and Braille.
    - Support for MathCAT specific keystrokes and features like setting and reading place markers in the Math Viewer.
    - Support for Unified English Braille (UEB) Math.
    In the May 2025 update, MathCAT is no longer under evaluation and is now used by default for interacting with math content in English releases of JAWS. A few other notable improvements include:
    - JAWS has been updated to use the latest release of the MathCAT library. This offers significant improvements with how JAWS speaks and displays math in Braille when working in the Math Viewer or Braille Math Editor.
    - MathCAT support now works on ARM PCs like the Microsoft Surface line of devices.
    - Improved reading tables in the Math Viewer using both speech and Braille. In particular, Braille now shows the current column and row information.
    - You can now press INSERT+EQUALS to quickly switch between Nemeth Braille and UEB to display math content in the Math Viewer or Braille Math Editor. Focus display users can also press RIGHT SHIFT+DOTS 1-2-3-4-5-6 on the display’s keyboard to switch the math Braille code.
    Note: For those who use JAWS in a language other than English, the legacy math support will continue to be used until we can bring MathCAT support to more languages.
    International Number Processing Improvements
    When reading various combinations of numbers, JAWS has traditionally allowed the speech synthesizer to process numbers and determine how they should be read. While this has worked well for English in most situations, some international users have struggled to have JAWS read numbers as expected in various languages.
    To address this, a new option, Controlled by JAWS, has been added to the Number Processing combo box in Settings Center. Selecting this option lets JAWS directly process various types of numbers, including Ordinals and currency, and send them to the synthesizer the way they should be read. Controlled by Synthesizer is still selected by default, but if the synthesizer currently in use is not speaking numbers as you expect to hear them, try switching to Controlled by JAWS and then listen to how numbers are spoken as you navigate a document or website.
    AI Labeler for Poorly Labeled Elements (Early Adopter Program)
    Frequently, you may encounter application screens or web pages containing inaccessible elements without proper labels, limiting usability for screen reader users. The AI Labeler helps to reduce these limitations by capturing a screenshot of the currently focused element, submitting it to an AI model for analyzing, and attempting to speak a more meaningful label. This feature can be used anywhere as it utilizes the current window of the active application and the focused UI element.
    How to Get Started
    1. In the JAWS Options menu, choose Early Adopter Program.
    2. Select AI Based UI Labeler.
    3. Select OK and restart the software.
    When an inaccessible element has focus, press INSERT+G. JAWS speaks a suggested graphics label. Currently, JAWS speaks the suggested label, type, and if available, the state of the element.
    If you turn this feature off through the Early Adopter Program dialog, pressing INSERT+G reverts to the legacy Graphics Labeler.
    Note: If company policies prevent the use of online or AI services, this feature will not be available.
    Submitting Feedback
    While evaluating the AI Labeler, you are encouraged to give feedback about your experience. Feedback can be given whether the feature is enabled or not.
    To give feedback, do the following:
    1. In the JAWS Options menu, choose Early Adopter Program.
    2. Select the Send Feedback button located after the AI Based UI Labeler check box.
    3. Complete the Early Adopter Program Feedback form and select Submit Feedback.
    ARIA and Web
    - When pressing INSERT+F on a web page to obtain font information, JAWS now indicates strike through font formatting.
    - When activating a same page link to jump to another location on the same web page, JAWS is now more reliably positioned at the correct location.
    - Enhanced the SHIFT+COMMA and SHIFT+PERIOD Navigation Quick Keys to now move to the beginning or end of a group element on a web page.
    - When pressing ALT+LEFT ARROW to go back a page, JAWS now places focus on the last link you activated instead of moving back to the top of the page.
    - Addressed instances where JAWS was reading web page content, but was not visually scrolling it into view.
    - JAWS now correctly announces the current cell position in a table grid when focus returns to the grid.
    - You can now reliably use JAWS table reading commands to review the SiriusXM channel guide.
    - JAWS no longer repeats the same item when using TAB to move through a menu with the Virtual PC Cursor active.
    - Improved JAWS announcement of position information for items in tree views with the Virtual PC Cursor off.
    - Improved JAWS announcement of progress bar updates on web pages.
    Braille
    - The Split Braille feature, which lets you display content from two different locations on the same Braille line, now works in the Math Viewer. For example, while focused on a particular part of an expression such as a cell in a matrix, press ALT+INSERT+V to open the Select Braille View dialog box, and select Buffered Text. You can then move to another part of the expression or to another application such as a Word document while the math content you chose to buffer remains displayed in the split region.
    - The Liblouis Braille translator used by JAWS and Fusion has been updated to version 3.33.0.
    - The Language combo box under Braille > General > Translation in Settings Center now includes an Ancient Languages – Writing System option. This allows you to display or enter text using a specific ancient language, which can be selected from the Input or Output combo boxes. Supported languages include: Biblical Hebrew, Borger, Akkadian, Cuneiform, and Ugaritic.
    - Improved the accuracy of entering text from a Braille display in Grade 1 when the JAWS language is set to Norwegian.
    - When entering text in Contracted Braille using Danish, JAWS now speaks the correct characters when using DOT 7 on the Braille display to delete.
    - Resolved an issue with the Japanese version of JAWS where the Japanese Braille translator was not available in Settings Center under Braille > Advanced.
    Google Suite
    - When the JAWS Google Docs Quick Keys layer (INSERT+SPACEBAR, G) is active, you can now press U or SHIFT+U to move to the next or prior suggestion.
    - Pressing INSERT+PAGE DOWN in Google Docs now announces the cursor location. This is the same as using the Google Docs command sequence ALT+CTRL+A, ALT+CTRL+L.
    - JAWS now correctly reads content on lines containing links that wrap to another line.
    Office Apps
    - To reduce excess speech in Excel, JAWS no longer speaks the message "Open Copilot (Control Comma)” after reading the contents of a cell.
    - In a Teams meeting, addressed an issue where JAWS was not announcing the Meeting Controls toolbar while navigating with TAB or SHIFT+TAB. Additionally, the INSERT+F8 keystroke works again to move focus directly to the toolbar in the current Teams window.
    - If JAWS is running by itself without ZoomText or Fusion and you open Teams or Outlook, the mouse pointer is now positioned in the top left corner of the screen by default. This keeps the mouse out of the main work area to avoid any unanticipated interactions.
    - With Track Changes enabled in Word, addressed an issue where users could not change from All Markup to Simple Markup while JAWS was running.
    - Resolved an issue where JAWS was still speaking revisions in Word documents even if Track Changes announcements were turned off in Quick Settings.
    - JAWS now announces the current state of the Outlook (new) Navigation pane when toggled using the Hide/Show navigation pane button.
    - The N command for navigating through messages in an open message thread now works as expected in Outlook (new).
    - Forms Mode now remains active when encountering a page break in a Microsoft Loop component.
    Visual Studio Code
    - Refined JAWS performance in the Find dialog box. This includes the PC Cursor now remaining active so you can type in the edit field without having to perform additional steps, as well as ESC now only needing to be pressed once to close the dialog.
    - Added a new Quick Settings option, Speak Line Numbers, which allows you to configure whether or not JAWS announces line numbers as you navigate documents using UP or DOWN ARROW.
    Other
    - When reading PDF documents containing Japanese text, JAWS no longer inserts extra spaces between characters.
    - Selecting the Dictate button in FSCompanion or pressing ALT+SHIFT+D now immediately stops JAWS speech so you can begin speaking without interruption.
    - FSCompanion is now available in the Dutch language.
    - Improved JAWS performance with the VistA application, used by the Department of Veterans Affairs in the United States.
    - JAWS now reads as expected in Windows 11 Notepad when navigating by line and the cursor is not at the beginning of a line.
    - JAWS no longer behaves as if focus is in a menu after maximizing a Notepad window.
    - If the Windows Game Bar is enabled, typing the letter G would sometimes not work as expected. This is now fixed.
    - After logging onto Windows, JAWS speech no longer continues reading group policy and other Windows details.
