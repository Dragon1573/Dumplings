    We've shipped AFFiNE 0.21!
    We are in the progress of fully rewriting our docs site. It's planed to be shiped with v0.22.0, so the current content might be outdated.
    Feel to raise issues against the docs or the product.
    Breaking changes
    Server config system
    We've introduced a brand new config system to make updating configs of servers much easier. The Admin panel got little refactor as well. Now you can update well noted configs in it and all config mutated in Admin panel will take effects immediately(No reboot required).
    The new config system is based on JSON and we provide a fully documented schema to make it even more clear. Check it out.
    You can configure your instance it the way like:
    Then import your update through instance's command line:
    node --import ./scripts/register.js ./dist/data/index.js import-config ./path/to/config.json
    Importing by command line requires a reboot.
    We will provide an import/export GUI on admin panel in 0.22, which will not require reboot.
    The old way to config AFFiNE instances by affine.js now is deprecated and will not take effect anymore. Some of the Environment Variables may still work, check the @environment annotation in schema.
