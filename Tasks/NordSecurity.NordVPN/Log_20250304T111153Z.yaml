    * For some of you, when connected to the VPN, the app wouldn’t show the “Connected” status. It was mysterious but unhelpful — so that's been fixed.
    * When using auto-connect, some of you may have noticed that the app connected to the VPN even when you were on a trusted Wi-Fi network. We've fixed this, so trusted networks are now truly trusted!
