    What you've known and trusted as Threat Protection has evolved into Threat Protection Pro. With its strong anti-malware features, this advanced cybersecurity product performs far beyond its original capabilities. Threat Protection Pro, now included in all plans above Basic, neutralizes a broad range of cyber threats, from web trackers to phishing attempts.

    If you're on the Basic plan, don't worry â€“ you'll continue to enjoy the light version of Threat Protection, now simply named Threat Protection. It uses DNS filtering to block intrusive ads and unsafe sites.
Version: 7.25.5.0
