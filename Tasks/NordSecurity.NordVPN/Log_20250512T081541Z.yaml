    * From now on, Dark Web Monitor takes you directly to your Nord Account dashboard, where you can conveniently manage your monitored email addresses and review found leaks. You’ll still get alerts in the app, but the full details unfold on the web.
    * If you’re a proud owner of a dedicated IP, you’ll find it at the top of your server list for faster access. If not, you’ll see a friendly banner instead – with an option to hide, of course.
    * We’ve also included a few fixes to keep your VPN running smoothly, just as it should.
