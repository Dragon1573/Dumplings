    * We've added more virtual location markers throughout the app. You'll find these handy markers on the map, in your recent connections, and in the “Auto-connect” settings.
    * After a bit of a journey, DNS filtering landed in the “Connections” settings, ready to fend off unwanted content. Now available for everyone with a Basic subscription.
    * Meshnet boasts new improvements:
    - You can now completely remove any device from Meshnet.
    - No more switching between tabs – personal and external devices are shown together.
    - New color cues help you easily distinguish between online and offline devices.
    - And the cherry on top – you can send files to offline devices directly from the dashboard. Your files will be delivered once the devices go back online.
