    - We've clearly marked virtual servers in our country list. This means you know exactly what kind of connection you're getting – be it a virtual location for a challenging region or a direct line to a physical server.
    - File protection’s activity feed is now cleaner and more focused. Safe files will pass through silently. But, if we detect malware or that sneaky double extension trick, we'll be sure to let you know.
    - We've refined our alerts for vulnerable apps to better describe what spotted vulnerabilities mean and how you can handle the risks.
Version: 7.21.2.0
