    🚀 ClaraVerse v0.1.0
    We had our previous beta releases so far and finally we are happy to announce our brand new drop with all the request features from the community
    The first official release is here — packed with major upgrades and new features:
    🔥 Highlights:
    - MCP (Multi-Component Pipeline) – Fully dynamic agent/tool flows
    - Create Your Own Tools – Native or N8N-based
    - Voice + Calling Support – Clara can now talk
    - Built-in Model Manager & Runner – Powered by llama.cpp, no Docker needed
    - Model Downloader – Grab GGUF models directly
    - Desktop Dashboard with Widgets – Customize your own AI control center
    - N8N Integration – Optional, plug it in only if needed

    ⚠️ Important:
    If you’ve used an earlier version, please delete and reinstall Clara to avoid conflicts.
    This release introduces breaking changes and a new structure.
