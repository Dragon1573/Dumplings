    New Features Added
    - The story format list is now a dialog instead of a separate screen.
    - A new preference has been added that allows disabling enhanced text editors, which can have problems with assistive technology. Disabling these editors disables syntax highlighting and some toolbar buttons, and you cannot control whether the cursor blinks in non-enhanced fields. (In that case, it will use your system setting.)
    Bugs Fixed
    - Validation of story format URLs now occurs when you try to add the format, not as you type in the field. This could cause the UI to become unresponsive.
    Story Format Updates
    - Chapbook has been updated to version 2.3.0.
