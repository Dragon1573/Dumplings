    What's new
    - User confirmation is now requested before canceling a point cloud import
    - Added a new geoid model:
      - Japan: JPGEO2024

    - Point clouds without normals can no longer be selected as input for the mesh generation
    - Saving a copy of the project (File>Save copy…) now also saves a copy of the unsaved active processing template (template.json)
    - Updated the point cloud point size slider to use a logarithmic scale
    - The point cloud import dialog can now be resized
    - The quality report is now available in German
    - Added an onboarding GIF for the point cloud manual registration tool
    - When a user cancels a project upload and the corresponding PIX4Dcloud project was not previously created, it will be removed
    Bug fixes and improvements
    - Fixed an issue where tie points could not be marked on uncalibrated images in projects using an arbitrary CRS
    - Restored the section line display in the image viewer when selecting a section geometry node
    - Fixed an issue that prevented the dense point cloud generation in a merged project created in versions 1.74 or 1.75
    - Fixed the update of the reprojection errors in the tie point table when importing marks while calibration is running
    - Fixed the issue with automatic processing template and settings selection failing for projects in ft or ftUS
    - Fixed an issue that prevented point clouds from becoming outdated when adding/editing tie points
    - Resolved an issue preventing the drag-and-drop functionality for LAS/LAZ files within a project
    - Fixed orthoplane issues:
      - The orthoplane pixel size now updates correctly when switching display units
      - Resolved an issue where the orthoplane pixel size used an incorrect value for processing when display units were set to feet
      - Fixed a rendering issue affecting small, low-resolution orthoplanes in the section view
    - Fixed an issue where mesh generation was incorrectly enabled when no calibrated cameras were available
    - Processing templates will now store and restore export paths relative to the project folder
    - Fixed the issue where the "Gaussian Splat" upload option was occasionally incorrectly enabled or disabled due to a bug in detecting whether the cloud "credits" feature was active in the user’s account
    - Fixed the issue where PIX4Dmatic/PIX4Dsurvey occasionally uploaded projects to the user's "default" organization instead of the organization chosen via the "Switch organization" tool
    - Fixed an issue where "Process in PIX4Dcloud" sometimes uploaded inconsistent tie point accuracy values, leading to processing failures in PIX4Dcloud
    Known issues
    - The SLPK mesh export format was temporarily removed for scalable meshes due to exporting issues
