    Improvements to “My Library”
    - As the library of games in GeForce NOW continues to grow and we add game library sync for more stores, we want to make it easier to manage your games and keep your most played games at your fingertips.
    - You can now click the heart icon to curate a “My Favorites” row to provide quick access to your favorite games in the app.  These games will be pinned first when viewing “My Library”.
    - You can also sort games in “My Library” by “Last Added” and “Last Played”.

    Enhanced Image Quality with 10-bit Color Precision
    - GeForce NOW Ultimate members will receive an image quality enhancement when launching on the GeForce NOW native Windows, macOS, or NVIDIA SHIELD TV app.
    - This update is especially helpful if you do not have an HDR display or if a game does not support HDR since 10-bit color precision will improve accuracy when streaming detailed color gradients like vibrant skies, dimly lit interiors, character skin tones, or loading screens and menus.
    - You can find this setting in the GeForce NOW app > Streaming Quality > Color precision. The 10-bit setting is recommended, but an 8-bit setting is available if your device is not supported.
    - For more information, visit the NVIDIA Knowledgebase.

    Bug Fixes
    - Fixed an issue on macOS where the GeForce NOW app was consuming excessive CPU resources and not responding after closing the app.
