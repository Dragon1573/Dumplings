    Today we released PIX version 2507.11, which can be downloaded here. This release includes everything in the previous 2505.30 release, plus the following bug fixes:
    - GPU Captures (capture time)
      - Fix capture-time crash caused by having opaque layout textures and buffers in the same upload heap
      - More explicitly disable support for Mesh Nodes (note: see Downloads page for a PIX build that supports Mesh Nodes)
    - GPU Captures timeline
      - Fix misc PIX bugs with counter collection, particularly affecting Intel GPUs
      - Fix crash clicking in occupancy lane when no data is present
      - Enable Timing Data on WARP if the driver has the right bug fixes
    - GPU Captures (other)
      - Strip off -Qstrip_reflect during Shader Edit and Continue, so that edited shaders work as expected inside PIX
      - Buffer formatter: add missing types retrieved from shader reflection (particularly 64-bit and 16-bit types)
      - Gather Accessed Resources: Fix crash when a state-object uses unbound descriptor range during DispatchRays (or DispatchGraph)
      - Mesh Viewer: remove unused/broken filter bar
    - Settings Pane:
      - Add public “Enable Debug Layer During Playback” option, to help debug PIX issues during playback
        - Also log debug layer errors to the PIX output view when it’s enabled
      - Fix alternative capture key dropdown menu
    - Other fixes/improvements
      - Fix potential startup crash in PIX, caused by importing duplicate metric views configurations into Timing Captures
      - Send Feedback button: Escape the feedback email subject/body, to make it support a wider range of mail clients
      - Process Launch: Remove quotes when copying from executable path to working directory
      - About Dialog: remove duplicate file entries, which also speeds the view up
    As usual, if you hit any issues or have any suggestions for us then please contact us via the “Send Feedback” button in PIX or via #pix on the DirectX Discord.
