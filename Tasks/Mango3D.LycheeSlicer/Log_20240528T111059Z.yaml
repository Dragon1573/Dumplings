    This new major version includes updates to both the Lychee Resin and Filament Slicers and is jam-packed with new features, bug fixes, and support for new Resin and Filament printers.

    New Feature
    - [Pro Resin] Grid Supports: You can now turn on Grid Supports and prepare your models more efficiently with better parenting and bracings. This feature will help you achieve a better support structure and print quality and save more resin.
    - [Pro Resin] Bracing Editor: Access an advanced editor to create your bracing presets.
    - [Pro Filament] Surface Ironing: Regular and fast ironing are available to produce smooth surfaces on flat surfaces.
    - [Pro Filament] Boolean Tool: use objects or 3D models to create subtractions and/or additions performed during the slicing process.
    - [Filament] Angle Seams placement: Change the layer position and seam placement at sharp angles of your models, making them less visible.
    improvements and optimizations
    - [Pro Resin] Inline Supports can now be used with the Mirror Mode
    - [Pro Resin] Painting Supports can now be used with the Mirror Mode
    - [Resin] Mirror Supports are now improved since you can choose to use the feature on the center of the scene (the world) or the center and orientation of the object (local)
    - [Pro Resin] Addition of Grid Supports to the Batch Tool
    - [Pro Resin] Addition of a “Generate Batch Report” checkbox in the Batch Tool
    - [Filament] We improved our FDM supports! We added a new support shape (cylinder) and a better zone selection when using Support At Slice. A raft is now added under the supports.
