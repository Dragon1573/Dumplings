    The uv build backend is now stable, and considered ready for production use.
    The uv build backend is a great choice for pure Python projects. It has reasonable defaults, with the goal of requiring zero configuration for most users, but provides flexible configuration to accommodate most Python project structures. It integrates tightly with uv, to improve messaging and user experience. It validates project metadata and structures, preventing common mistakes. And, finally, it's very fast â€” uv sync on a new project (from uv init) is 10-30x faster than with other build backends.
    To use uv as a build backend in an existing project, add uv_build to the [build-system] section in your pyproject.toml:
    [build-system]
    requires = ["uv_build>=0.7.19,<0.8.0"]
    build-backend = "uv_build"
    In a future release, it will replace hatchling as the default in uv init. As before, uv will remain compatible with all standards-compliant build backends.
