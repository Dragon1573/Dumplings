    This is a patch release that resolves several user-reported issues. Thank you!
    - On Windows, notifications could not appear because of an issue checking Windows "Quiet Hours" settings
    - Dragging and dropping file attachments to the composer or the signature editor resulted in a path error.
    - On Windows, you may need to install Language Packs for some languages to be available for spellcheck, and this no longer causes an error.
    - The RPM build no longer generate build_id links to prevent conflicts when installing multiple Electron apps.
