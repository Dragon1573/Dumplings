    A new 2025.2 EAP build is now available. It includes the following major updates related to CLion Nova:
    - When working in remote mode, the typing assistant now runs on the thin client instead of the server. This means your internet connection no longer affects the IDEâ€™s responsiveness. Features like auto-inserting pair parentheses or smart indentation when pressing Backspace are now as fast as in local mode.
    - CLion Nova now correctly imports #defines from a header unit, which is transitively imported through a named module and directly imported at the same time.
    - The false Zero constant can be replaced with nullptr warning no longer appears when a literal 0 is compared with an expression of a standard comparison category type.
    Please share your feedback and report any issues to our issue tracker.
