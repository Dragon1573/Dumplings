    A new EAP build for CLion 2025.2 includes the following major updates:
    - The live watches feature is now enabled by default for the SEGGER J-Link and ST-LINK debug servers. You can also enable it for a generic debug server, but it may be unstable. Learn more about live watches in this blog post.
    - With CLion Nova enabled, you can now create custom folding regions in the editor using //region and //endregion.
    - When creating a new Meson library project, CLion now generates a relevant template project with more suitable source files.
    - CLion Nova no longer displays a false Unreachable code warning at the final curly brace of certain functions.
    - Importing a template that is defined in one module and specialized in another now works as expected in CLion Nova.
