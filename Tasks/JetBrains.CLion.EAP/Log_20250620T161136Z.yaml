    The new 2025.2 EAP build includes the following major updates:
    - The ESP-IDF debug server is now available, making it easier to configure and debug ESP-IDF projects.
    - CLion Nova can now detect some compilation errors that were previously missed and display the corresponding warnings in the editor. Previously, these errors only appeared in the terminal once the build step was complete.
    - Qt signals are no longer incorrectly identified as non-signals.
    - CLion Nova now supports ะก11 atomic types.
    - The Move caret down after Comment with Line Comment action now works as expected in CLion Nova.
    - The IDE now correctly recognizes the inclusion of the cstddef header, which was previously treated as unused.
