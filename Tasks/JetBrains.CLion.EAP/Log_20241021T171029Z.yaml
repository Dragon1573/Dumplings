    A new EAP build for CLion 2024.3 is now available.
    Here are some of the key updates:
    - CLion Nova now includes function call hierarchy support.
    - Project status notifications have been moved from the editor to the new project status widget and are now less distracting.
    - When attaching to an unstarted process while debugging, the IDE only selects processes that belong to the current user.
    - Reloading a CMake project using the Reset Cache and Reload Project option no longer causes an error when the FTP/SFTP/WebDAV Connectivity plugin is disabled.
    Please share your feedback and report any issues to our issue tracker.
