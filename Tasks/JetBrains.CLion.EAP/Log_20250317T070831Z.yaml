    The CLion 2025.1 Beta is now available, offering new features for the CLion Nova language engine, debugger, and embedded development that we’ve added throughout the 2025.1 EAP. The build also includes several important bug fixes.
    Key features:
    - CLion Nova now provides full code analysis and code assistance functionality for header and source files that are not included in a project, just like for regular project files.
    - We’ve added basic support for Objective-C in CLion Nova, allowing you to see syntax highlighting, warnings, code completion suggestions, and other Clangd-based features.
    - The CLion debugger now supports Qt renderers, also known as Qt pretty printers and Qt debugging helpers, allowing you to view Qt variables in a human-readable form.
    - CLion’s debugger now supports custom LLDBs for macOS and Linux.
    - You can now view two-channel OpenCV matrices as images during debugging.
    - We’ve reworked the approach to create a new STM32CubeMX project to make it more convenient and provide support for more STM32 chips and project types.
    - When working with Zephyr projects, you can now use the west build command options and sysbuild as your primary build system.
    - You can now interact with AI Assistant directly in the editor using natural language prompts.
    Main bug fixes:
    - When using CLion Nova, changes to the tab width in the Code Style settings are no longer reset after a project reloads.
    - CLion Nova now correctly handles _Float types in the implementation of the std::format, which means resolving std::format when using GCC now works as expected.
    - Creating a new PlatformIO project from CLion’s Welcome screen now works as intended.
    - Opening a file in LightEdit mode no longer crashes the IDE.
