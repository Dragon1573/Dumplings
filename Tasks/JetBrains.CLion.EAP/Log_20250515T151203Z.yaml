    The first EAP build for CLion 2025.2 is here!
    Here are some of the key features:
    - We’ve made the project status widget more prominent again to make it easier to identify and resolve issues with a project configuration.
    - CLion Nova’s integration with GoogleTest was extended by adding the TEST_P macro. This allows you to run the same parameterized test with different input values.
    - CLion Nova now supports the _BitInt(N) type introduced in the C23 standard, allowing you to specify integer types with exact bit widths.
    - We’ve fixed CLion Nova issues that caused missed compilation errors that appeared only in the terminal. Now, CLion Nova catches all the errors before you click Build, Run, or Debug.
    For more details, see the blog post.
    Please share your feedback and report any issues to our issue tracker.
