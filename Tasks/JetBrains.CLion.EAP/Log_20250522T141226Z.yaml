    A new EAP build for CLion 2025.2 is now available.
    It includes the following major updates:
    - When using Step Into during debugging, you can now skip non-user code, such as library calls. The default stepping rules are pre-configured in Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Debugger | Stepping, and the IDE also reads configuration file types, such as .natstepfilter.
    - CLionâ€™s FreeRTOS integration now includes support for Arm Cortex-M52 and Arm Cortex-M85.
    There are also several improvements to CLion Nova:
    - We've added the Jump outside closing bracket/quote with Tab when typing smart key.
    - The IDE no longer shows errors when using C++ modules.
    - The formatter now adds an option for a space before a colon in a constructor initializer.
    - The editor can now display index inlay hints in initializer lists that contain std::initializer_list elements.
    Please share your feedback and report any issues to our issue tracker.
