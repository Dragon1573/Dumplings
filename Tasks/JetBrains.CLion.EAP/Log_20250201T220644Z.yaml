    A new EAP build for CLion 2025.1 is now available.
    It includes the following key updates:
    - The CLion debugger now supports Qt renderers, also known as Qt pretty printers and Qt debugging helpers, allowing you to view Qt variables in a human-readable form.
    - The Go to Header/Source navigation action now works as expected in CLion Nova.
    - When you open a project with files not specified in the project model, such as CMake, CLion Nova now treats them as files included in the project and provides all language features.
    - Opening a file in LightEdit mode no longer crashes the IDE.
    - New keyword groups are available for the C/C++ formatting color scheme, such as Builtin type, Control flow keyword, and Control transfer keyword.
    - CLion Nova now correctly handles _Float types in the implementation of the std::format, which means resolving std::format when using GCC now works as expected.
    - False positives no longer appear for members of anonymous structures and unions.
    - Weâ€™ve added support for OpenCL vector types created with the ext_vector_type attribute.
    - CLion Nova now supports the ?: operator, also known as the Elvis operator.
