    CLion 2025.1 Beta 2 is now available with several improvements and bug fixes.
    The key updates are related to CLion Nova:
    - AI Assistant suggestions now work as intended when renaming functions, classes, global variables, or other symbols.
    - CLion Nova no longer considers out-of-project C files as ะก++ files, thus providing proper language support for these C files.
    - CLion Nova no longer indexes all out-of-project files, so the IDE is ready to work more quickly.
    - The Extend Selection action now works correctly.
    Read our blog post to learn more about the major features planned for the upcoming CLion release.
