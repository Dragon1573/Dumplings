    The CLion 2024.3 Beta is now available, offering new features for CLion Nova, embedded development, and debugging that we’ve added throughout the 2024.3 EAP. The build also includes several important bug fixes.
    The key features:
    - The IDE frontend and backend improvements have significantly reduced CLion Nova’s memory footprint, particularly evident when handling large projects like Chromium.
    - The Debug Servers configuration option helps you streamline the process of configuring debugging for embedded and remote development.
    - With the OpenCV image viewer, you can now view a two-dimensional OpenCV array as an image while debugging.
    - You can now attach the debugger to an unstarted process, which is helpful when you need to debug an executable launched by a third-party program or a script.
    The key bug fixes:
    - When a board is not defined for a new Zephyr West project or a West executable path is incorrect, CLion now offers to fix it.
    - The Refresh button in the Call Hierarchy tool window now works as intended when the actual call hierarchy in the source code has been changed.
    - AI Assistant again highlighted C/C++ code in the chat when you ask it to explain code or suggest a refactoring, for example.
    To learn more about all the major features and bug fixes, read our blog post.
