    FEATURES:
    - core: Enhanced the existing inline field in the shell provisioner to support any script with its own shebang (#!).
      Allows users to provide scripts directly in the inline field, making it possible to use scripts generated by functions like templatefile.
      Ensures that the shell provisioner executes the given script as intended, honoring the script's shebang line.
      GH-13313
    - core: Added new built-in functions to Packer:
      sum
      startswith
      endswith
      These new functions expand the capabilities for template logic and variable handling in Packer builds.
      GH-13349
    IMPROVEMENTS:
    - hcl2: Added the ability for the packer fmt command to format multiple HCL files at once.
      This enhancement allows users to format several files in a single command invocation.
      GH-13362
    BUG FIXES:
    - core: Updated the documentation to explicitly state that a trailing slash is required when uploading directories, regardless of the guest OS.
      This clarification is intended to ensure consistent behavior and prevent confusion, especially for Windows users.
      GH-13309
    - core: Fixed an error occurring when using the --use-sequential-evaluation flag with packer console.
      Updated the FlagSets to correctly include this flag, resolving the error.
      GH-13316
    - core: added a wrapper around inline PowerShell commands executed by the provisioner to catch errors and ensure the Packer build fails if any command results in an error.
      GH-13334
    - hcl2: Ensures that Packer now preserves the user-defined order of variable files as input by the user.
      This change maintains the intended precedence of variables, honoring the order specified on the command line.
