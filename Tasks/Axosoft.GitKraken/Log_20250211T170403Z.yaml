    New ✨
    - Find your repos and branches faster! You can now search directly in the repository and branch dropdowns from the breadcrumb in the toolbar.
      - Repository search: Searching in the repository dropdown will search through all repositories in the Repository Management tab. Selecting a new repo will open it in the current tab or switch to that tab if it’s already opened.
      - Branch search: Searching in branch dropdown will search through all local branches in the repo, and selecting a branch will checkout that branch. If your repository has worktrees, they’ll appear at the top of the branches list for easy access.

    Improvements 🙌
    - Custom Launchpad views are now only visible when the corresponding Team or Personal mode they were created in is selected.
    - Experimental Feature – Git Executable:
      - Added support for ‘Discard all changes’ and connected Undo/Redo actions.
      - Added partial support for ‘Discard changes’ of unstaged files.
      - Interactive rebase now replays all rebased commits instead of fast-forwarding over the unchanged ones.

    Bug Fixes 🐛
    - Fixed an issue where cloning a repo can create an undefined folder with hooks files inside.
