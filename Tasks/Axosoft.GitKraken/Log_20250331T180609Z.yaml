        - You’ll now be able to generate clear, meaningful commit messages based on your code changes in just a click.
        - With a WIP selected, click on the sparkle icon in the commit message form to have GitKraken AI generate a commit message for you based on your staged changes.
      - Explain Commits
        - You can now get detailed summaries of changes made in your repository without spending time diving through files and diffs.
        - With one or multiple commits selected in the Commit Graph, click on the Explain button in the top right of the Commit Panel to generate an explanation of changes made in the selected commits.
