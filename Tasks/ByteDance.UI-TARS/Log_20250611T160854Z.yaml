    Getting started with Remote Operator is easy: just download and install version 0.2.0 of UI-TARS-Desktop. On the new home page, you‚Äôll find the ‚ÄúUse Remote Computer‚Äù and ‚ÄúUse Remote Browser‚Äù buttons‚Äîclick either one to start your experience.

    Simply enter the GUI tasks you want to accomplish in the chat panel on the left, and the AI model will operate the remote device for you. Each session gives you 30 minutes of free remote access, and after the session ends, you can immediately start a new 30-minute free instance‚Äîexplore and enjoy without limits.
