  Key: ReleaseNotes
  Value: |-
    The application now runs on .NET Framework 4.8 instead of .NET Framework 3.5
    Added built in queries for computers running Windows 11 and Windows Server 2025
    Added an option to use LDAPS instead of LDAP, which uses port 636 with SSL encryption
    When using plain LDAP (not LDAPS) connections now use "signing and sealing" so network traffic will still be encrypted in most scenarios
    Errors encountered during Global Catalog searches for universal group membership will now be shown in the query progress window instead of only in debug logs
    Improved command line help
    Performance improvements
    Free edition can now be directly upgraded to standard edition without requiring a separate installation
