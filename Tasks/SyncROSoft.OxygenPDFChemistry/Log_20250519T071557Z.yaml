This version adds the ability to control Chemistry console logging, implemented various bug fixes, and addressed issues that were reported by the community.

    Core
    Control Logging
    It is now possible to control the Chemistry console logging by using a custom logback.xml configuration file along with the new -log-file parameter. This is helpful if you want to hide the INFO messages or write the logs into a separate file.
