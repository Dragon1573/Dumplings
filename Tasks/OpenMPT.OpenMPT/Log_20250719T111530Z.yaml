    Playback
    - [Fix] <js> Avoid potential read past end of sample data in a specific combination of reverse sample playback + offset past sample loop.
    - [Fix] <js> Since OpenMPT 1.32.01.00, swapping between samples on the rear channels could introduce a click on the front channels.

    IT
    - [Fix] <js> Volume column slides no longer propagate their effect memory to the regular effect column volume slides.

    Other formats
    - [Imp] <js> FC: Allow files with a sequence size of 0 to load (fixes a broken copy of cult.smod).

    Misc
    - [Mod] <js> To improve accessibility, keyboard focus is now only returned to the lower editor views if the last input method before an interaction in the upper view was done through the mouse. If the last interaction was through the keyboard instead, the keyboard focus remains there (http://forum.openmpt.org/index.php?msg=51008).
    - [Mod] <js> Keyboard Settings: A pointless warning sound was played when adding the first shortcut for a command
    - [Fix] <js> Keyboard Settings: Since OpenMPT 1.32.01.00, the first command in the command list was no longer selected for keyboard navigation (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1908).
    - [Fix] <jh> Wine Integration is no longer offered on Wine 10.11 due to a Wine bug breaking it (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1904).
