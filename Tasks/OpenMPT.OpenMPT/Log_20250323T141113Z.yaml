    Sample tab
    - [Imp] <js> Relaxed BRR file rejection heuristics a bit (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1859).
    - [Imp] <js> Loop and cue point information is now also copied for sample selections (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1869).
    - [Fix] <js> Possible crash when replacing a sample with a shorter one while outside of the sample editor, and then returning to the same sample slot (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1866).
    - [Fix] <js> Drawing sample data from right to left caused the drawn lines to not be interpolated properly.

    Instrument tab
    - [Fix] <js> Fixed crash when trying to remove the only point of an envelope.

    Misc
    - [Fix] <js> If multiple keyboard layouts were installed, note key mapping could be based on the wrong layout, causing e.g. B-4 and Note-Off keys to be swapped on the default key map with an active US keyboard layout but also a German layout being present.

    Third-Party Libraries
