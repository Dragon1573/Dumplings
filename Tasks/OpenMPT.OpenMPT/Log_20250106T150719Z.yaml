    Pattern tab
    - [Fix] <js> Upon data entry, the status bar display was not updated unless playback was running.
    - [Fix] <js> Fixed potential crash when trying to move the cursor past the start or end of a pattern when the order list is empty (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1854).

    Sample tab
    - [Imp] <js> Pressing Ctrl while moving loop points or clicking loop start / end spin buttons now moves the loop, keeping the loop length constant.
    - [Imp] <js> Cue preview shortcuts now set the cue point if it's currently unused and the sample is being previewed (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1852).
    - [Fix] <js> Time stretching didn't update cue points.

    Playback
    - [Fix] <js> Default velocity for instrument plugins was broken in OpenMPT 1.31.13.00 (tx coda).
    - [Fix] <js> MIDI Macros: An unfinished byte right before an "s" SysEx checksum macro letter was not considered in the checksum.
    - [Fix] <js> Avoid NNA channel starvation due to sample-based instruments that have a MIDI channel assigned and NNA set to "Continue". It can still happen if a VST plugin or the MIDI I/O plugin is associated with the instrument. Other built-in plugins are not affected (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1848).

    XM
    - [Imp] <js> Warn when saving an instrument that references more than 16 (compatibility export) or 32 samples (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1846).
    - [Imp] <js> Identify XMs saved with Digitrakker that were converted from other formats.
    - [Fix] <js> In non-compatible linear slide mode, the sample rate could wrap around with portamento slides to extremely low frequencies. This should only happen in compatible mode.

    Other formats
    - [Imp] <js> MO3: XM dummy command W is now imported.
    - [Fix] <js> ITP: Instruments paths were always read as relative paths since OpenMPT 1.31.01.00, usually causing them to fail to load.
    - [Fix] <js> ITP: Since OpenMPT 1.28.01.00, instrument and envelope flags were no longer read correctly.

    Misc
    - [Imp] <js> Fine tempo adjustment shortcuts now also work with formats that don't support fractional tempo.
    - [Imp] <js> "Find MPT Hacks" now warns when an XM instrument uses more than 16 samples (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1846).
    - [Fix] <js> Passing a relative path to a module file as a command-line parameter for OpenMPT did not work as intended since OpenMPT 1.29.10.00.
    - [Fix] <js> Real BPM approximation reported infinity when rows per beat was set to 0. A default of 4 rows per beat is now assumed in this situation.
    - [Fix] <js> Advanced Settings: It was not possible to enter fractional values for settings of type float with system locales using a decimal separator other than ".".

    Third-Party Libraries
    - [Imp] Update mpg123 (v1.32.10) and unrar (v7.1.2).
