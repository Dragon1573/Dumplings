    Tree view
    - [Fix] <js> Since OpenMPT 1.32.01.00, the MIDI input focus remained on the tree view after dragging an instrument to a sample or instrument editor, while keyboard input focus was on the editor (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1899).

    Pattern tab
    - [Imp] <js> Added keyboard shortcuts for expanding and shrinking patterns (default: Ctrl + Alt + E / D).

    Sample tab
    - [Imp] <jh> FLAC encoding can now be configured to be multithreaded, using all available CPU cores, by toggling the hidden setting "Sample Editor.FLACMultithreading".

    Instrument tab
    - [Fix] <cs127> When saving an ITI file, parts of the volume envelope were damaged (http://github.com/OpenMPT/openmpt/pull/32).
    - [Fix] <js> Switching between envelopes using keyboard shortcuts didn't update accessible announcements (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1892).

    Playback
    - [Fix] <js> Previewing a sample, instrument or pattern note after pausing playback in a module using synth instruments continued playing those synth instruments (tx squeaktoy).

    MPTM
    - [Fix] <js> Inserting / duplicating / moving sequences reset the default tempo and speed for all sequences (http://forum.openmpt.org/index.php?topic=7345.0).

    IT
    - [Fix] <js> Picking up a note after a Note Cut effect through a lone instrument number restores the original note pitch without any portamento slides, as if there was a note.
    - [Fix] <js> If there is a note and a tone portamento next to a Note Cut effect, the Note Cut is not executed - unless there is also a row delay effect and we are on the second repetition of the row.

    S3M
    - [Mod] <js> Old ModPlug Tracker versions allowed to use the 28th character of sample names to be used. Such sample names are now displayed correctly again.

    Other formats
    - [Fix] <js> MED: When triggering a synth note with a Synth Jump command on the same row, the initial speed command was not executed (http://www.un4seen.com/forum/?msg=145046).

    Stream Export
    - [Imp] <js> The currently active subsong is now selected by default for the single subsong export mode, subsong field for single-subsong export to the currently edited subsong. This also applies to OPL and MIDI export (http://forum.openmpt.org/index.php?topic=7340.0).
    - [Imp] <js> In export dialogs, the song index within the selected sequence is now also shown (http://forum.openmpt.org/index.php?topic=7340.0).
    - [Imp] <jh> FLAC encoding is now multithreaded by default, using all available CPU cores. Can be disabled by toggling the hidden setting "Export.FLACMultithreading".

    Misc
    - [Imp] <js> Main toolbar: Icon groups can now be hidden as well. At least one icon group needs to be always visible, though (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1889).
    - [Imp] <js> Added help button to Setup dialog title bar.
    - [Imp] <js> A few more icons are now inverted when using dark themes.
    - [Imp] <js> Added a default key binding for Toggle Between Upper / Lower View (Ctrl + Shift + Tab).
    - [Imp] <js> TCB has been added to list of recognized file extensions for TCB Tracker modules. Both ModLand and Fujiology use .TCB instead of the canonical .MOD extension.
    - [Fix] <js> Estimate Song Length: Subsong start order format was not adhering to the "Display rows / orders in hex" setting.
    - [Fix] <js> Large parts of the GUI were broken in XP / Vista builds when running them on Windows 10 version 1607 or newer. (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1887).
    - [Fix] <js> On Windows XP / Vista and Wine versions older 3.13, message boxes there were supposed to only show once were always shown instead.

    Third-Party Libraries
    - [Imp] Update miniz (v3.0.2), mpg123 (v1.33.0) and ogg (v1.3.6)
