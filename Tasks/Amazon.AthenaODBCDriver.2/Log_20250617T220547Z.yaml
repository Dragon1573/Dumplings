    The Amazon Athena ODBC v2.0.4.0 driver contains the following improvements and fixes.
    Improvements
    - Result Fetcher â€“ The driver now automatically selects the method to download query results. This removes the need to manually configure the fetcher in most situations. For more information, see Result fetcher.
    - Curl Library has been updated to 8.12.1.
    Fixes
    - Fixed proxy configuration for IAM profile when connecting to STS. The fix allows IAM Profile to be used for successful authentication.
    - Read all additional configuration options for IAM profile with authentication plugins. This includes UseProxyForIdP, SSL_Insecure, LakeformationEnabled, and LoginToRP to resolve misconfigurations for the affected plugins.
    - Fixed round function by allowing it to take in an optional 2nd parameter. It successfully processes queries containing the escape syntax.
    - Fixed column size for TIME WITH TIME ZONE and TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE data types. Values with timestamp and timezone data type will not get truncated.
