    New and enhanced features

    General Features
    - Updates to support Omnissa Horizon
    Installation changes required to support the new Omnissa Horizon client have been added for Windows, Linux(Ubuntu only) and MacOS in this release. The VDI Zoom Workplace client has also been updated for the branding change to Omnissa Horizon.

    - Support for Screen Capture keyboard shortcut
    Screen capture for VDI has been updated to support using the keyboard shortcut (CTRL + T) at any time.

    - Multi-share pop-out tab support for single and multiple monitors
    Updates made to the standard Windows client (v6.2.0) have been incorporated into this release to support opening a share session as a new window pop-out.

    Resolved Issues

    General fixes
    - VDI client application name
    The name of the application has been changed to Zoom VDI Workplace.

    Windows fixes
    - VDI Plugin Mgmt updates pop up UAC dialog for 64-bit installation
    An issue was discovered where the service that provides administrator privileges when installing the VDI plugin (when using VDI Plugin Management) was no longer running after a reboot of the 6.2.10 or 6.2.11 release. The issue was traced to changes made in the standard client and the fix has been incorporated into this release.

    - Optimization for Webview cache files
    Customer deployments where %APPDATA% directory for the virtual machine was moved to a server reported performance issues resulting from the number of temporary webview cache files being written to the server. A change has been made in this release to use %LOCALAPPDATA% for Webview cache files instead.

    Linux fixes
    - Share content lost after resizing when using CWA 2408 with eLux
    An issue where the share session was no longer displayed after resizing an upscaled and windowed Citrix session has been corrected. The problem occurs when using Citrix Workplace client version 2408 or greater with eLux.

    - Desktop freezes after ending a remote control session
    A problem has been addressed where a Dell ThinOS clientâ€™s virtual desktop would freeze after ending a remote control session with another participant.

    MacOS fixes
    - Potential issue where Citrix Workspace could hang when disconnecting
    An issue has been corrected where the Citrix Workspace client could hang when attempting to disconnect.

    Amazon fixes
    - Blurry video when moving meeting to a different monitor
    A problem has been addressed where the meeting video could appear slightly blurry when the window was moved to another monitor.

    - Video lost when moving to a different monitor
    Improvements have been made for tracking how multiple monitors are accounted for. The changes correct an issue where dragging a meeting window to a new monitor could result in lost video.

    HP Anyware fixes
    - Updates for Ubuntu/HP ThinPro plugin support
    Changes have been made to address reported issues when using the recent Linux plugins added for the HP Anyware platform. These include an issue where a black video is displayed after disconnecting and reconnecting without exiting the HP Anyware client.
