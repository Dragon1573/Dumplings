    - ðŸš¨ (BREAKING) ðŸš¨ We upgraded the version of Rust used to build Volta, which drops support for older versions of glibc & Linux kernel. See the Rust announcement from August 2022 for details about the supported versions. Notably, this means that we no longer support CentOS 6 (#1611)
    - ðŸš¨ (BREAKING) ðŸš¨ Due to costs and changes in the code signing process, we have dropped the code signing for the Windows installer. We now recommend using winget to install Volta on Windows (#1650)
    - ðŸŽ‰ (NEW) ðŸŽ‰ We now ship a pre-built binary for ARM Linux & ARM Windows (#1696, #1801)
    - Volta no longer requires Developer Mode to be enabled on Windows (#1755)
    - volta uninstall now provides better help & error messages to describe its use and limitations (#1628, #1786)
    - Volta will now use a universal binary on Mac, rather than separate Intel- & ARM-specific builds (#1635)
    - Switched to installing profile scripts into .zshenv by default, rather than .zshrc (#1657)
    - Added a default shim for the yarnpkg command, which is an alias of yarn (#1670)
    - Added a new --very-verbose flag to enable even more logging (note: we haven't yet implemented much additional logging) (#1815)
    - Simplified the fetching process to remove an extra network request and resolve hangs (#1812)
    - Several dependency upgrades and clean-up refactors from @tottoto
