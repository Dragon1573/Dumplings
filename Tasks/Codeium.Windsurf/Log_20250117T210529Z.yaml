    Cascade Memories, Web Search and Docs

    Web and Docs Search
    - Cascade can now search the web! There are a couple of ways to use this:
      - Automatically: Simply ask a query that needs a live internet search and Cascade will trigger web search automatically.
      - URL Input: Paste in a URL and Cascade will use your URL as context (works well with blog posts, docs, articles, public GitHub files, etc.).
      - @web: If you prefer to explicitly ask Cascade to search the web, use the @web command.
      - @docs: Cascade can search through some popular documentation sites, including Windsurf's own help docs!
    - Web tools like search and URL reading can be enabled and disabled via the Windsurf Settings panel in the bottom right of your status bar.
    - A web search is 1 flow action credit and the resulting URL page reads are additional credits.

    Cascade Auto-Generated Memories
    - Cascade can now automatically generate memories to retain context between conversations
    - You can prompt Cascade to create a memory at any time if you want it to remember key context
    - Memories are visible in the Memories Panel, which is accessible when Cascade makes a memory or through the command palette
    - Memories can be deleted from the Memories Panel
    - Memories do not cost any flow action credits to generate

    Improvements to Dev Container Support (Beta)

    - UI Tweaks to Dev Container workspace labels
    - Registers a command to reopen the current Dev Container workspace locally, enabling a switch from Dev Container to local workspace

    - Fixed a bug where in-editor diff decorations would not be correctly synced with Cascade after reverting to a past step
    - Fixed a bug where renaming, moving, or deleting a file with an active Cascade diff would cause the changes overview popover to freeze on subsequent steps

    - Fixed bugs in Cascade's find tool, hopefully reducing errors in Cascade tool usage
    - Performance improvements with Cascade and better visibility into errors
