    WSJT-X 2.7.0 is a General Availability (GA) release, the first since
    version 2.6.1. Major enhancements include a new companion program
    QMAP, new Special Operating Activities "Q65 Pileup" and "SuperFox", a
    new "Message System" feature, an option to update Hamlib at the click
    of a button, and various other improvements.

     - QMAP is of particular interest to those engaged in Earth-Moon-Earth
       (EME) communication. It provides single-polarization receive-only
       capabilities for any one of the 60-second submodes of Q65 and the
       associated 30-second submode with the same tone spacing. It lets
       you monitor all corresponding traffic in a 90 kHz sub-band while
       conducting EME QSOs in the usual way with WSJT-X.

     - Q65 Pileup mode helps DX operators using Q65 in circumstances with
       many simultaneous callers and very weak signals, such as those
       experienced by 6-meter EME DXpeditions.

     - SuperFox mode behaves operationally like the old-style Fox and Hounds
       mode but uses a new constant envelope waveform for Fox’s transmissions.
       Messages can be transmitted simultaneously to as many as 9 Hounds with
       no signal-strength penalty, resulting in a system gain of about +10 dB
       compared to the older Fox-and-Hound operation using 5 slots.

     - The new Message System allows structured plain text messages to be
       sent to your QSO partner to request QSY to another band or mode, or
       to send any one of a number of canned messages. This feature can be
       especially useful during contests.

     - A button labeled "Update Hamlib" lets you download and install the
       latest version of the rig-control features in Hamlib.

     - The cty.dat file can now be updated by clicking a single button.

    Numerous other enhancements and bug fixes make operation smoother and
    more intuitive. Features for main-window switching between modes have
    been enhanced so that submode and status of the Sh and Fast checkboxes
    are saved and restored by mode. Note that the "Update Hamlib" feature
    is currently available only in Windows.
Version: 2.7.0
