    On behalf of the IronPython team, I'm very happy to announce the release of IronPython 3.4.2. The runtime targets are .NET Framework 4.6.2, .NET 6 and .NET 8. The baseline for IronPython 3.4 is Python 3.4.
    Resolves an issue which prevented IronPython from working on .NET 9, as well as a number of bug fixes and improvements.
    Thanks to @BCSharp and @Lamparter for the contributions!
