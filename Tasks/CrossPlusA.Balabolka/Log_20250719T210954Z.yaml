    [-] Fixed the using of ElevenLabs Text-To-Speech.
    [-] Fixed the applying of bookmarks.
    [-] Fixed pauses between sentences and paragraphs on Windows 7.
    [*] Updated the settings for "Timer".
    [*] Resources for Bulgarian, Italian, Korean and Uzbek languages were updated (thanks to Kostadin Kolev, Massimo Castiglia, Kim Young-Gam and Ulugbek Tolakov).
    [-] Judging by the tests, Microsoft developers fixed a bug in the MMDevApi.dll system library: after installing the KB5060829 update for Windows 11 24H2, the library functions work without an error. But I can't bring back the use of the MMDevApi.dll library in my application yet, as I have to wait until the update will be installed on most computers with Windows 11.
ReleaseTime: 2025-07-19
