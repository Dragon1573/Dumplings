    * Reduce the chance of leaving unused Assistant and File resources in the OpenAI account
    * Fix using ${WING:PROJECT_DIR} and other environment variable references in a Python File OS Command
    * Expand the size of the file and directory selector field to match the width of all forms
    * Prompt to configure the AI Provider if necessary from AI Refactor
    * Fix debugger on Windows when 2+ versions of Python are loaded in the same process

    Changes

    * Add optional argument untitled_vector_stores to command internal-ai-delete-resources
      to support removal of all untitled vector stores from an OpenAI account.  The AI Chat feature
      prior to this release used OpenAI v1 API and may have created these in large numbers.
