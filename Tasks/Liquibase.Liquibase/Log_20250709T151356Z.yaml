    Liquibase 4.33.0 is a major release
    Liquibase 4.33.0 delivers important updates across Policy Checks, Change Automation, and other areas of platform enhancement, along with critical bug fixes and improvements to MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and DB2 on Z/OS support. See the Liquibase 4.33.0 Release Notes for the complete set of release information.
    Notable Changes
    [PRO]
    Change Automation
    - PostgreSQL Composite TYPE Support in Database Inspection. Liquibase Pro now includes support for inspecting PostgreSQL Composite TYPE objects during database inspection operations such as snapshot and diff. This enhancement ensures Composite TYPEs appear in inspection outputs, helping users manage and track changes to complex data structures more effectively. [INT-1249] [INT-135]
    - PostgreSQL Composite TYPE Support in generate-changelog and diff-changelog. Liquibase Pro now includes support for detecting PostgreSQL composite TYPE objects during generate-changelog and diff-changelog operations. This enhancement ensures that composite TYPE definitions‚Äîused to group multiple fields into a custom data structure‚Äîare captured and modeled alongside other schema elements, helping users manage and track changes more comprehensively. [INT-1251]
    - PostgreSQL Password Escaping Enhancement. Liquibase now escapes special characters in PostgreSQL passwords when using the psql native executor. Previously, if a password included characters requiring percent-encoding (such as @, %, or #), the executor would fail with a psql: error: invalid percent-encoded token message. [DAT-20254]
    - Db2 on Z/OS JCL Executor. Liquibase Pro now includes the ability to submit JCL jobs to the mainframe via Db2 DSNUTILU stored procedure. This enables users to automate more sophisticated procedures by integrating system level activities and database activities in a standard changelog format. This feature is enabled by a runwith:JCL decoration on applicable changesets containing properly formatted JCL.[INT-573, INT-1217]
    - Improved Persistent Spool File Behavior for SQLPlus Executor. The SQLPlus executor ensures that spool files are always retained when --sqlplus-create-spool=true, giving users consistent access to output files. Previously, spool file retention was tied to the --sqlplus-keep-temp setting; now, this setting applies only to temporary SQL files, not spool files. This decoupling improves clarity and gives users more control‚Äîif a spool file is created, it will remain unless users opt out by setting --sqlplus-create-spool=false. [DAT-18983]
    Policy Checks
    - MongoChangetypeAttributes Policy Check. Introduced a new quality check named MongoChangetypeAttributes that allows users to enforce specific values or patterns for attributes within MongoDB-specific changetypes. Users can select a single Mongo changetype (e.g., createIndex, dropCollection) and specify expected values or patterns for its attributes. The check triggers if a specified attribute is present but does not match the defined value or regex‚Äîensuring consistent standards across Mongo changesets. This supports validation across key changetypes attributes like adminCommand, createCollection, insertOne, and more, and enhances control and quality enforcement in MongoDB deployment pipelines. [DAT-18275]
    [OSS]
    Important dependency updates
    - Liquibase OSS 4.33+ has Java 24 core build support.
    - The liquibase-cdi and liquibase-cdi-jakarta modules are still supported, but have been removed from the OSS distribution to their own repositories at https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-cdi and https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-cdi-jakarta
    ‚ö†Ô∏è[PRO] and [OSS] Upcoming Change in Distributions
    Liquibase is evolving to better serve both open-source contributors and enterprise customers by introducing a clearer separation between its Open Source (OSS) and PRO offerings. This change is designed to ensure that each distribution is optimized for its respective users‚Äîproviding open-source users with flexibility and control, while delivering scalability, reliability, and governance for enterprise teams.
    The new structure enables Liquibase to more effectively support developers at all stages‚Äîfrom experimentation and community collaboration to mission-critical deployments. Liquibase 4.32.0 introduced the first general availability (GA) release of independently packaged Pro distributions, along with dedicated distribution channels and key-based access enforcement for Pro capabilities. This marks a significant step toward delivering a curated, enterprise-grade experience for Pro users.
    The OSS distribution and its delivery channels remain unchanged in this phase.
