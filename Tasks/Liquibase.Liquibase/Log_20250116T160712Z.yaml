    Liquibase 4.31.0 is a major release

    [!NOTE] See the Liquibase 4.31.0 Release Notes for the complete set of release information.
    Notable Changes
    [PRO]
    New Checks extension delivered in the box
    - Policy Checks are undoubtedly one of Liquibase Pro's stickiest capabilities, for which we continually add database platforms, new checks, and customizations. But to get these developments, users would need to download and upgrade to the latest Liquibase. Not any more! With this new checks extension, you can deploy the latest Policy Checks powers by optionally upgrading just the Check Extension on your cadence. Conveniently, this extension is delivered "in the box" at /internal/extensions, so you do not have to change anything about your current Policy Checks workflow.
    - Learn more https://docs.liquibase.com/pro-extensions
    Other Checks Enhancements
    - Pro users can suppress sql in reports with the new global property: --reports-suppress-sql=true
    - New checks-settings files can be created without CLI prompts by adding --force to checks show command
    - By popular demand, checks reports now show all checks run, including those not triggered.
    - We simplified the custom python check creation flow by removing the single-answer prompts/

    Liquibase capability enhancements
    - Changesets with entirely blank IDs will fail validation. This is a breaking change.
      - NOTE: Validation should not fail for changes that have already been ran. Changes that have been ran with an empty changeset id that are marked as runOnChange or runAlways WILL fail validation.
    - Added changeset execution time to output and logs
    - Added calculated checksum to output of calculate-checksum command
    - Added two new command parameters to history command so users can better see tagged deployments without having to directly examine the DATABASECHANGELOG table
      - show-tags will return only tagged deployment history
      - tag-filter will return deployment history for a specific tag or group of tags
    - If an XML changelog is generate-changelog and fails to validate, Liquibase will indicate where the codepoint where the XML failure is located.
    - Added new Spring properties for Pro license key and to disable analytics
    Java API Changes
    - Added missing changeLogParameters argument to generateChangeLog, calculateCheckSum, doChangeLogSyncSql, and changeLogSync
