    - gh-110519: Deprecation warning about non-integer number in gettext now alwais refers to the line in the user code where gettext function or method is used. Previously it could refer to a line in gettext code.

    - gh-110365: Fix termios.tcsetattr() bug that was overwritting existing errors during parsing integers from term list.
    - gh-110196: Add __reduce__ method to IPv6Address in order to keep scope_id

    - bpo-40262: The ssl.SSLSocket.recv_into() method no longer requires the buffer argument to implement __len__ and supports buffers with arbitrary item size.

    Documentation
    - gh-108826: dis module command-line interface is now mentioned in documentation.
    Tests
    - gh-110367: Make regrtest --verbose3 option compatible with --huntrleaks -jN options. The ./python -m test -j1 -R 3:3 --verbose3 command now works as expected. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-111309: distutils tests can now be run via unittest.
    - gh-111165: Remove no longer used functions run_unittest() and run_doctest() and class BasicTestRunner from the test.support module.
    - gh-110932: Fix regrtest if the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH environment variable is defined: use the variable value as the random seed. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-110995: test_gdb: Fix detection of gdb built without Python scripting support. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-110918: Test case matching patterns specified by options --match, --ignore, --matchfile and --ignorefile are now tested in the order of specification, and the last match determines whether the test case be run or ignored.
    - gh-110647: Fix test_stress_modifying_handlers() of test_signal. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-103053: Fix test_tools.test_freeze on FreeBSD: run “make distclean” instead of “make clean” in the copied source directory to remove also the “python” program. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-110167: Fix a deadlock in test_socket when server fails with a timeout but the client is still running in its thread. Don’t hold a lock to call cleanup functions in doCleanups(). One of the cleanup function waits until the client completes, whereas the client could deadlock if it called addCleanup() in such situation. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-110388: Add tests for tty.
    - gh-81002: Add tests for termios.
    - gh-110267: Add tests for pickling and copying PyStructSequence objects. Patched by Xuehai Pan.
    - gh-109974: Fix race conditions in test_threading lock tests. Wait until a condition is met rather than using time.sleep() with a hardcoded number of seconds. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-109972: Split test_gdb.py file into a test_gdb package made of multiple tests, so tests can now be run in parallel. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-104736: Fix test_gdb on Python built with LLVM clang 16 on Linux ppc64le (ex: Fedora 38). Search patterns in gdb “bt” command output to detect when gdb fails to retrieve the traceback. For example, skip a test if Backtrace stopped: frame did not save the PC is found. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-108927: Fixed order dependence in running tests in the same process when a test that has submodules (e.g. test_importlib) follows a test that imports its submodule (e.g. test_importlib.util) and precedes a test (e.g. test_unittest or test_compileall) that uses that submodule.
    Build
    - gh-103053: “make check-clean-src” now also checks if the “python” program is found in the source directory: fail with an error if it does exist. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-109191: Fix compile error when building with recent versions of libedit.
    Windows
    - gh-110913: WindowsConsoleIO now correctly chunks large buffers without splitting up UTF-8 sequences.
    - gh-110437: Allows overriding the source of VC redistributables so that releases can be guaranteed to never downgrade between updates.
    - gh-109286: Update Windows installer to use SQLite 3.43.1.
    macOS
    - gh-110950: Update macOS installer to include an upstream Tcl/Tk fix for the Secure coding is not enabled for restorable state! warning encountered in Tkinter on macOS 14 Sonoma.
    - gh-111015: Ensure that IDLE.app and Python Launcher.app are installed with appropriate permissions on macOS builds.
    - gh-109286: Update macOS installer to use SQLite 3.43.1.
    - gh-71383: Update macOS installer to include an upstream Tcl/Tk fix for the ttk::ThemeChanged error encountered in Tkinter.
    - gh-92603: Update macOS installer to include a fix accepted by upstream Tcl/Tk for a crash encountered after the first tkinter.Tk() instance is destroyed.
    - gh-99834: Update macOS installer to Tcl/Tk 8.6.13.
    IDLE
    - bpo-35668: Add docstrings to the IDLE debugger module. Fix two bugs: initialize Idb.botframe (should be in Bdb); in Idb.in_rpc_code, check whether prev_frame is None before trying to use it. Greatly expand test_debugger.
    C API
    - gh-112438: Fix support of format units “es”, “et”, “es#”, and “et#” in nested tuples in PyArg_ParseTuple()-like functions.
    - gh-109521: PyImport_GetImporter() now sets RuntimeError if it fails to get sys.path_hooks or sys.path_importer_cache or they are not list and dict correspondingly. Previously it could return NULL without setting error in obscure cases, crash or raise SystemError if these attributes have wrong type.
