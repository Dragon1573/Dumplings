    WINDOWS USERS
    If you have installed versions 0.35.2 or older, perform a manual uninstall and then install the new version of QLog. There is no need to worry about your QSOs during the uninstall, as the uninstall procedure does not delete the internal data of QLog. Of course, a backup is always recommended.
    If you have installed versions 0.36 or newer, then it is not necessary to perform an uninstall.
    LINUX USERS
    There is a known issue where QLog does not correctly restore the Layout. The bug is in the QT library and in QLog it is solved by a workaround, which does not always work. If the layout does not restore correctly, try clicking on the Activity again.
