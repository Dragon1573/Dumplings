    Known Issues in 6000.0.20f1
    - Editor Platform: [Linux] Crash on 'PPtr::operator RuntimeAnimatorController*() const' when saving a new animation file (UUM-79812)
    - Graphics Optimization Systems: Shader errors in DXC when building an empty URP project for Windows platform on a MacOS machine (UUM-78665)
    - Hybrid Renderer: [Linux] Crash on ScriptableBatchRenderer::GenerateBuiltInCBuffer when adding "PerObjectData.ReflectionProbes" (UUM-79332)
    - Lighting: Block compression leads to lightbaking artifacts in HDRP (UUM-74735)
    - SRP Core: [URP 3D Sample] Light rendering artifacts visible in Universal 3D Sample Template. It seems to be that Shader Graphs/Screen_Graph is causing the issue. Disabling objects with this material will no longer reproduce light artifacts.
      [UUM-78796] <https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/light-rendering-artifacts-visible-in-universal-3d-sample-template>
