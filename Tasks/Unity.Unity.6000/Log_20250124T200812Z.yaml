    Known Issues in 6000.0.35f1
    - 3D Physics: "Failed to create Convex Mesh from source mesh" PhysX errors are thrown when looking around the Scene View while Collision Geometry is set to true (UUM-93081)
    - Asset - Database: Crash on MonoBehaviour::Transfer when the XR Interaction Toolkit Sample Assets are updated (UUM-76934)
    - Audio Authoring: Audio Reverb Zone still produces sound when the Audio Source volume is 0 (UUM-92689)
    - Audio Authoring: Audio Source clip is not audible when exceeding a high number of active Audio Sources (UUM-91256)
    - Build Settings Window: Application Cloud Connection Id is incorrect when using Build Profile with Player Setting Overrides. (UUM-90426)
    - DirectX12: A memory leak occurs in Play mode when using Direct3D12 Graphics API (UUM-91900)
    - DirectX12: Allocated graphics memory does not get released when the Editor is out of focus while using D3D12 graphics API (UUM-86354)
    - DirectX12: The Camera does not render correctly when the Camera.Rect() is changed and HDR is enabled and DX12 graphics API is selected (UUM-86917)
    - Graphics Optimization Systems: Vertex snapping doesn't work when the GPU Resident Drawer is enabled (UUM-66422)
    - HDRP: Graphics Compositor breaks Unity rendering when the "Output Camera" is changed to a scene Camera and one Camera SubLayer is active.

    - Input: Player .exe remains open as a background task after closing it when Active Input Handling is set to "Input System Package (New)" (UUM-91181)
    - Materials: Decal Projector produces artifacts when the normal and decal are projected in negative z-direction and Normal Blend is set to 1 (UUM-92200)
    - Packman: Unable to install ProBuilder package when project is located in an external FAT32/exFAT drive (UUM-86351)
    - Scene Hierarchy: Undoing GameObject creation doesn't work when the GameObject is focused (UUM-92601)
    - Scene View: Can not navigate through the Scene view when using a drawing tablet (UUM-90436)
    - Serialization: The "UniversalRenderPipelineGlobalSettings.asset" is creating noise in the git diff when building a Player (UUM-80052)
    - Serialization: [windows only] Switching Project when importing complete project does not import all assets and project opens incomplete (UUM-88051)
    - SpeedTree: This release of SpeedTree includes a change to the interface of the SpeedTree8Wind shadergraph node. If you have an animated SpeedTree in the shadergraph, be sure to connect an ObjectSpacePosition node to the input of the SpeedTree8Wind. If the wind node does not have an input on the ObjectSpacePosition port, the mesh will be shrunk down to a point at origin (making it seem to vanish).
      https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/UUM-84616
    - Terrain: Trees do not render in 'Unity Terrain - URP Demo Scene' (UUM-84616)

    - Vulkan: [Android] [Vulkan] Cubes stuck on the first few frames of rotation and application flickering when an Overlay Camera is added to the Camera Stack with MSAA enabled (UUM-92429)
    - Windows: Player remains in Windows Background processes when the application is closed (UUM-87775)

    - 2D: Fixed issue where the SceneView grid is not restored when the currently selected GameObject with a Grid/Tilemap with its Grid showing is destroyed. (UUM-91461)
    - 2D: Fixed issue with the 2D renderers getting information about the SRP and the status of the Shaders under SRP. (UUM-90437)
    - AI: Fixed an issue by logging a warning in the editor when CalculatePath() starts or ends on multiple NavMesh surfaces. (UUM-84579)

    - Editor: Fixed console being cleared after building a player. (UUM-91487)
    - Editor: Fixed issue with missing blue outline when dropping an asset in a folder. (UUM-87749)
    - Editor: Fixed the double restart prompts when toggling virtual texturing on Windows. (UUM-87735)

    - Editor: [Android] Fixed deprecation warning message to suggest the UnityEditor.Android.UserBuildSettings.DebugSymbols.level property instead of UnityEditor.Android.DebugSymbols.level on Unity 6.0. (UUM-91350)
    - Graphics: Addressed crash issue with DX11 Tessellation Displacement sample project from the asset store. (UUM-74198)

    - Physics: Secured a mass properties recomputation case for Rigidbody components. A error message would be printed in the console if a concave MeshCollider would be present under a kinematic Rigidbody during authoring. This issue would happen due to a unsecured path inside the 'Awake' logic of Rigidbody where mass recomputation would be attempted on this setup. The PhysX SDK would log a message informing that the attempted operation was invalid on the aforementioned setup. (UUM-86499)
