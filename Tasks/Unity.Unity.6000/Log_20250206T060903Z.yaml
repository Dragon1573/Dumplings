    Known Issues in 6000.0.37f1
    - 3D Physics: "Failed to create Convex Mesh from source mesh" PhysX errors are thrown when looking around the Scene View while Collision Geometry is set to true (UUM-93081)
    - Audio Authoring: Audio Reverb Zone still produces sound when the Audio Source volume is 0 (UUM-92689)
    - Audio Authoring: Audio Source clip is not audible when exceeding a high number of active Audio Sources (UUM-91256)
    - DirectX12: A memory leak occurs in Play mode when using Direct3D12 Graphics API (UUM-91900)
    - DirectX12: Allocated graphics memory does not get released when the Editor is out of focus while using D3D12 graphics API (UUM-86354)
    - DirectX12: Increased Memory usage when Update Mode 'On Demand' Realtime lights are used and DX12 API is selected (UUM-90065)
    - HDRP: Graphics Compositor breaks Unity rendering when the "Output Camera" is changed to a scene Camera and one Camera SubLayer is active.

    - Materials: Decal Projector produces artifacts when the normal and decal are projected in negative z-direction and Normal Blend is set to 1 (UUM-92200)
    - Packman: Unable to install ProBuilder package when project is located in an external FAT32/exFAT drive (UUM-86351)
    - Scripting Runtime: Crash on UnityEditor.AssetDatabase:StopAssetEditing when removing HDRP Package after having imported Water Samples (UUM-78164)
    - Serialization: The "UniversalRenderPipelineGlobalSettings.asset" is creating noise in the git diff when building a Player (UUM-80052)
    - Serialization: [windows only] Switching Project when importing complete project does not import all assets and project opens incomplete (UUM-88051)
    - SpeedTree: This release of SpeedTree includes a change to the interface of the SpeedTree8Wind shadergraph node. If you have an animated SpeedTree in the shadergraph, be sure to connect an ObjectSpacePosition node to the input of the SpeedTree8Wind. If the wind node does not have an input on the ObjectSpacePosition port, the mesh will be shrunk down to a point at origin (making it seem to vanish).

    - Texture: Sprite Atlas Override for iOS setting remains disabled when saving its change to enabled (UUM-90066)
    6000.0.37f1 Release Notes
    API Changes
    - GI: Added: LightingDataAsset.SetLights() which lets you overwrite the lights associated with a specific Lighting Data Asset. This can be used to change lights between baked and realtime without rebaking. (UUM-78573)
    - GI: Added: Lightmapping.GetLightingDataAssetForScene() and Lightmapping.SetLightingDataAssetForScene() which let you get or set the Lighting Data Asset associated with a particular scene. (UUM-78573)
    Fixes
    - 2D: Fixed an issue where when pushing property block by index to SpriteShapeRenderer crashes. (UUM-90089)
    - 2D: Fixed an issue with the Unlit shader for Skinning. (UUM-92940)
    - 2D: Fixed Sprite Editor Window's 'Apply' and 'Revert' button positions are swapped. (UUM-92562)
    - Accessibility: Fixed an issue by updating the invalid USS selector. (UUM-95326)
    - AI: Fixed an issue where sometimes the navigation path contained points outside of the shortest trajectory. (UUM-78679)
    - Android: Fixed an issue where StartActivityIndicator is displayed outside of safe area. (UUM-82238)
    - Android: Fixed an issue where the AndroidActivityIndicatorStyle enum did not change. (UUM-79911)
    - Android: Fixed an issue where the Player lost focus when UnityEngine.Handheld.StartActivityIndicator() was used with the Facebook SDK. (UUM-87564)
    - Android: Fixed build and run to work correctly when exporting an app bundle project. (UUM-91102)
    - Asset Bundles: Fixed an issue by adding a new flag BuildAssetBundleOptions.StripUnatlasedSpriteCopies to the legacy asset bundle system. Currently if we have assets in multiple bundles that depend upon a source texture we copy it into all relevant bundles. Setting this new flag will keep from creating duplicates if the texture does not belong to a sprite atlas. (UUM-83067)
    - Editor: Fixed a crash when exiting and re-entering play mode with incomplete InstantiateAsync operations. (UUM-86892)
    - Editor: Fixed a issue where the Shortcut HelperBar could not be reactivated after being disabled in the preferences. (UUM-92862)

    - Editor: Fixed an issue by making fog density field use Slider(). (UUM-83752)
    - Editor: Fixed an issue to WindowsEditor keeps the main EditorWindow snapped when the Layout changes. (UUM-90338)
    - Editor: Fixed an issue where baked only shadows caused an increase in light intensity. (UUM-93148)
    - Editor: Fixed an issue where enabling the scene view camera overlay would trigger synchronous shader compilation even if asynchronous compilation is enabled (UUM-79996)
    - Editor: Fixed an issue where horizontal scrolling would not work when using a trackpad gesture. (UUM-84867)
    - Editor: Fixed an issue where navigating Scene View with a pen tablet would not work after returning to the Editor from another application. (UUM-90436)
    - Editor: Fixed an issue where pressing Shift+Tab in the inspector would focus a completely different tab. (UUM-87588)

    - Editor: Slight optimization to loading/processing Profile traces. (UUM-92831)
    - Editor: Update Editor splash screen copyright to 2025. (UUM-93029)
    - GI: Fixed an issue where baking only Adaptive Probe Volumes would update lights in an unpersistent way, causing double contribution with realtime lighting after scene reload. (UUM-78573)
    - GI: Fixed an issue where lighting data was missing for scenes loaded from asset bundles in editor. (UUM-93115)
    - GI: Fixed an issue where some files produced by Adaptive Probe Volume baking would be read-only. (UUM-90236)
