    6000.0.15f1 Release Notes
    Improvements
    - GI: Added the ability to click on renderers in the Lightmap Preview window to select them in the Hierarchy.
    - UI Toolkit: Improved the navigation event handling logic for the slider.
      When the slider detects move events aligned with the slider's direction, it adjusts the slider's value. If it detects a navigation submit event, it disables the movable class on the dragger element, causing all navigation events to revert to their default behavior. A second navigation submit event re-enables the class on the dragger and restores the previous customized behavior. (UUM-75128)
    - UI Toolkit: It is now possible to adjust the MinMaxSliders values using directional navigation. The navigation submit command can be used to toggle between min value adjustment, max value adjustment and focus adjustment modes. (UUM-73854)
    API Changes
    - Editor: Deprecated: PlayerSettings.captureSingleScreen. (UUM-74786)
    - Physics: Added: Fixed 'Reuse Collision Callbacks' behaviour in CharacterController; when on it now prevents garbage generation when using the OnControllerColliderHit callback. (UUM-60515)
    Changes
    - Package Manager: Changed the label in Project Settings from Enable Pre-release Packages to Show Pre-release Package Versions.
    Fixes
    - 2D: Fixed closure of overlay menu in the Tile Palette window when the user moves the cursor over the clipboard of the Tile Palette. (UUM-75501)
    - 2D: Fixed issue where the picking marquee can be seen twice when the user picks cells in the Tile Palette initially and picks again while keeping the pointer down. (UUM-77333)
    - 2D: Fixed issue where the Tile Palette clipboard is slow to update when undocked and hovering over the SceneView window. (UUM-77045)
    - Android: Fixed Default Video Resolution for secondary orientation. The resolution is now correct when device is rotated while playing a file using the video player. (UUM-57168)
    - Android: Fixed Input.backButtonLeavesApp not working on the new input system. (UUM-41638)
    - Animation: Removed warning messages when changing the model of the Animation Preview in the Inspector. (UUM-74163)
    - Audio: Fixed an issue where Pitchfield clamping was not set to -1200 to +1200 range. (UUM-73045)
    - DX12: Fixed Editor hangs during the Material conversion process,. (UUM-77034)
    - Editor: Added Clarifying note on PBXProject.GetPBXProjectPath for VisionOS Platforms. (UUM-58830)

    - Editor: Fixed an issue where searching for shortcuts by binding in the Shortcuts window was inconsistent. (UUM-73960)
    - Editor: Fixed an issue with Render Graph culled passes still being considered during the merge of passes. (UUM-75338)
    - Editor: Fixed excessive job allocation in ComputeShadowSplitMasksForOneLight which was causing Out Of Memory errors and lagging. (UUM-74917)
    - Editor: Fixed for Linux editor now shows up a solid black texture even though it is interactable. (UUM-77104)

    - Editor: Switch to FNV-1a for Render Graph. (UUM-74849)
    - HDRP: Fixed offscreen UI rendering when HDR is enabled. (UUM-60896)
    - iOS: Fixed colors being changed in the snapshot (when app is going to the background) when using wide color. (UUM-76011)
    - iOS: Fixed occasional crash on exit. (UUM-75473)
    - iOS: Removed empty node from Privacy Manifest, which was potentially causing ITMS-91056: Invalid privacy manifest rejections from Apple. (UUM-77041)

    - Physics: Fixed a memory leak inside the physics debug draw logic where the filtering data would never be released.

    - Physics: Fixed an issue where creating new PhysicsMaterial assets would trigger a deserialization error due to the asset type attempting to fetch the default material from PhysicsMaterialReset rather than PhysicsMaterialSmartReset. The later is normally used to access other objects during creation. (UUM-76665)
    - Scene/Game View: Fixed an issue where an exception would be thrown if MeshRenderer's material was pinged while in 'Gray' prefab context mode. (UUM-73488)
    - Scripting: Fixed Application.exitCancellationToken is called at wrong time when it is registered before the Start. (UUM-73462)

    - UI Toolkit: Fixed ArgumentOutOfRangeException thrown in console window using controller when selecting default choice in dropdown. (UUM-73468)

    - Undo System: Protect recorded objects in undo from being modified while generating the undo action. (UUM-77033)
    - Universal RP: Fixed URP Full Screen Render Feature with RenderGraph to limit the use of global resources and improve memory usage. (UUM-74448)
