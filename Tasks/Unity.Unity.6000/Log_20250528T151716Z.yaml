    - 2D: Fixed issue where the mask interaction settings of one TilemapRenderer can persist to the next immediate TilemapRenderer. (UUM-103926)
    - 2D: Fixed RGB 48 bit format for SpriteAtlas. (UUM-104007)
    - 2D: Fixed TextureImporter meta file modification when reimporting a texture while the "Default Behaviour Mode" is set to 2D for new imported files. (UUM-104536)

    - AI: The HeightMesh was sometimes containing faulty polygons that stretched between arbitrary vertices over long distances. (UUM-78065)
    - Animation: Fixed an issue where undoing the creation of an AnimatorController layer while the layer view was not visible in the Animator Window would throw exceptions. (UUM-104017)
    - Asset Pipeline: Fixed problem where main thread in editor or player could become blocked, while async loading is in progress. (UUM-104218)
    - Documentation: Added documentation for CommandBuffer.BuildRayTracingAccelerationStructure method parameters.
    - Editor: Before running the macOS Editor, perform a check if Rosetta is installed and if not then prompt to install it. (UUM-104562)
    - Editor: Changing the UnityEvent target in the inspector will now clear the method when incompatible. (UUM-101710)
    - Editor: Editor can crash when playable graph topology is changed by an animation event callback. (UUM-104081)
    - Editor: Editor: Enum fields not showing on click for OSX when TapToClick is enabled. (UUM-91306)

So now the updating of tree instances is bypassed in this scenario. Re-enabling tree rendering will resume updating tree instance and detail renderers. When tree rendering is enabled, performance remains roughly the same as before. (UUM-98086)
