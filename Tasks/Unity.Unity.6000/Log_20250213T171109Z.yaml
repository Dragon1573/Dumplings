    Known Issues in 6000.0.38f1
    - 3D Physics: Freeze when calling Rigidbody.SweepTestAll in a specific project (UUM-96080)
    - Android: [iOS] [UnityWebRequest] Requests with "UnityWebRequest" are open for SSL Proxying (UUM-97194)
    - Audio Authoring: Audio Reverb Zone still produces sound when the Audio Source volume is 0 (UUM-92689)
    - Audio Authoring: Audio Source clip is not audible when exceeding a high number of active Audio Sources (UUM-91256)
    - DirectX12: Allocated graphics memory does not get released when the Editor is out of focus while using D3D12 graphics API (UUM-86354)
    - DOTS: URP Cascaded Shadows do not have a falloff in Player when the Player is built not in Development Mode (UUM-97415)
    - HDRP: Graphics Compositor breaks Unity rendering when the "Output Camera" is changed to a scene Camera and one Camera SubLayer is active.
      https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/UUM-84610
    - Lighting: Increased Memory usage when Update Mode 'On Demand' Realtime lights are used and DX12 API is selected (UUM-90065)
    - Scripting Runtime: Crash on UnityEditor.AssetDatabase:StopAssetEditing when removing HDRP Package after having imported Water Samples (UUM-78164)
    - Serialization: The "UniversalRenderPipelineGlobalSettings.asset" is creating noise in the git diff when building a Player (UUM-80052)
    - Serialization: [windows only] Switching Project when importing complete project does not import all assets and project opens incomplete (UUM-88051)
    - SpeedTree: This release of SpeedTree includes a change to the interface of the SpeedTree8Wind shadergraph node. If you have an animated SpeedTree in the shadergraph, be sure to connect an ObjectSpacePosition node to the input of the SpeedTree8Wind. If the wind node does not have an input on the ObjectSpacePosition port, the mesh will be shrunk down to a point at origin (making it seem to vanish).
