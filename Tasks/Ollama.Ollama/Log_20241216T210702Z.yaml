    New models
    - EXAONE 3.5: a collection of instruction-tuned bilingual (English and Korean) generative models ranging from 2.4B to 32B parameters, developed and released by LG AI Research.
    What's Changed
    - Fixed issue where whitespace would get trimmed from prompt when images were provided
    - Improved memory estimation when scheduling models
    - OLLAMA_ORIGINS will now check hosts in a case insensitive manner
    Note: the Linux ollama-linux-amd64.tgz directory structure has changed â€“ if you manually install Ollama on Linux, make sure to retain the new directory layout and contents of the tar file.
