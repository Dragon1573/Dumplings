    What's Changed
    - Ollama will now better utilize available VRAM, leading to less out-of-memory errors, as well as better GPU utilization
    - When running larger models that don't fit into VRAM on macOS, Ollama will now split the model between GPU and CPU to maximize performance.
    - Fixed several issues where Ollama would hang upon encountering an error
    - Fix issue where using quotes in OLLAMA_ORIGINS would cause an error
