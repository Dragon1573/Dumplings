    New models
    - DeepSeek-R1-0528: A new version of DeepSeek-R1 with significantly improved depth of reasoning and inference capabilities.
    ollama pull deepseek-r1
    Thinking mode
    Ollama now supports thinking mode.
    To enable thinking mode in Ollama, first download models that support thinking:
    ollama pull deepseek-r1
    ollama pull qwen3
    Thinking
    When running a model that supports thinking, Ollama will now display the model's thoughts:
    % ollama run deepseek-r1
    >>> How many Rs are in strawberry
    Thinking...
    First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's asking how many letters 'R' are present in the word "strawberry."

    Next, I'll examine each letter in the word individually.

    I'll start from the beginning and count every occurrence of the letter 'R.'

    After reviewing all the letters, I determine that there are three instances where the letter 'R' appears in the word "strawberry."
    ...done thinking.

    There are three **Rs** in the word **"strawberry"**.
    In Ollama's API, a model's thinking is now returned as a separate thinking field for easy parsing:
    {
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "thinking": "First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's asking how many letters 'R' are present in the word "strawberry...",
        "content": "There are **3** instances of the letter **R** in the word **"strawberry."**"
      }
    }
    Turning thinking on and off
    In the API, thinking can be enabled by passing "think": true and disabled by passing "think": false
    curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d '{
      "model": "deepseek-r1",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "Why is the sky blue?"
        },
      ],
      "think": true
    }'
    In Ollama's CLI, use /set think and /set nothink to enable and disable thinking.
