    New models:
    - Llama 3: a new model by Meta, and the most capable openly available LLM to date
    - Phi 3 Mini: a new 3.8B parameters, lightweight, state-of-the-art open model by Microsoft.
    - Moondream moondream is a small vision language model designed to run efficiently on edge devices.
    - Llama 3 Gradient 1048K: A Llama 3 fine-tune by Gradient to support up to a 1M token context window.
    - Dolphin Llama 3: The uncensored Dolphin model, trained by Eric Hartford and based on Llama 3 with a variety of instruction, conversational, and coding skills.
    - Qwen 110B: The first Qwen model over 100B parameters in size with outstanding performance in evaluations
    - Llama 3 Gradient: A fine-tune of Llama 3 the supports a context window of up 1M tokens.
    What's Changed
    - Fixed issues where the model would not terminate, causing the API to hang.
    - Fixed a series of out of memory errors on Apple Silicon Macs
    - Fixed out of memory errors when running Mixtral architecture models
    Experimental concurrency features
    New concurrency features are coming soon to Ollama. They are available
    - OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL: Handle multiple requests simultaneously for a single model
    - OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS: Load multiple models simultaneously
    To enable these features, set the environment variables for ollama serve. For more info see this guide:
    OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=4 OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=4 ollama serve
