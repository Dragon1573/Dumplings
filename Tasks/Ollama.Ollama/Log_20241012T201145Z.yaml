    New safety models
    - Llama Guard 3: a series of models by Meta, fine-tuned for content safety classification of LLM inputs and responses.
    - ShieldGemma: ShieldGemma is set of instruction tuned models from Google DeepMind for evaluating the safety of text prompt input and text output responses against a set of defined safety policies.
    What's Changed
    - Default model in quickstart is now llama3.2
    - Fixed issue where ollama pull would leave connections when encountering an error
    - ollama rm will now stop a model if it is running prior to deleting it
    New Go runner (for contributors):
    Ollama is transitioning to a new Go-based subprocess model runner with improved reliability and caching. This new runner found under the llama directory replaces the previous code under llm/ext_server. During this transition period, the new Go runner is opt-in at build time, and requires using a different approach to build. For more information see development.md.
