    New embedding models
    - BGE-M3: a large embedding model from BAAI distinguished for its versatility in Multi-Functionality, Multi-Linguality, and Multi-Granularity.
    - BGE-Large: a large embedding model trained in english.
    - Paraphrase-Multilingual: A multilingual embedding model trained on parallel data for 50+ languages.
    New embedding endpoint with batch support
    Ollama now supports a new API endpoint /api/embed for embedding generation:
    curl http://localhost:11434/api/embed -d '{
      "model": "all-minilm",
      "input": ["Why is the sky blue?", "Why is the grass green?"]
    }'
    This API endpoint supports new features:
    - Batches: generate embeddings for several documents in one request
    - Normalized embeddings: embeddings are now normalized, improving similarity results
    - Truncation: a new truncate parameter that will error if set to false
    - Metrics: responses include load_duration, total_duration and prompt_eval_count metrics
    See the API documentation for more details and examples.
    What's Changed
    - Fixed initial slow download speeds on Windows
    - NUMA support will now be autodetected by Ollama to improve performance
    - Fixed issue where the /api/embed would sometimes return embedding results out of order
