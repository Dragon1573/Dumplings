    New models
    - Llama 3 ChatQA: A model from NVIDIA based on Llama 3 that excels at conversational question answering (QA) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
    What's Changed
    - Quantization: ollama create can now quantize models when importing them using the --quantize or -q flag:
    ollama create -f Modelfile --quantize q4_0 mymodel
    [!NOTE] --quantize works when importing float16 or float32 models:
    - From a binary GGUF files (e.g. FROM ./model.gguf)
    - From a library model (e.g. FROM llama3:8b-instruct-fp16)
    - Fixed issue where inference subprocesses wouldn't be cleaned up on shutdown.
    - Fixed a series out of memory errors when loading models on multi-GPU systems
    - Ctrl+J characters will now properly add newlines in ollama run
    - Fixed issues when running ollama show for vision models
    - OPTIONS requests to the Ollama API will no longer result in errors
    - Fixed issue where partially downloaded files wouldn't be cleaned up
    - Added a new done_reason field in responses describing why generation stopped responding
    - Ollama will now more accurately estimate how much memory is available on multi-GPU systems especially when running different models one after another
