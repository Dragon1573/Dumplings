    What's Changed
    ollama ps
    A new command is now available: ollama ps. This command displays currently loaded models, their memory footprint, and the processors used (GPU or CPU):
    % ollama ps
    NAME             	ID          	SIZE  	PROCESSOR      	UNTIL
    mixtral:latest   	7708c059a8bb	28 GB 	47%/53% CPU/GPU	Forever
    llama3:latest    	a6990ed6be41	5.5 GB	100% GPU       	4 minutes from now
    all-minilm:latest	1b226e2802db	585 MB	100% GPU       	4 minutes from now
    /clear
    To clear the chat history for a session when running ollama run, use /clear:
    >>> /clear
    Cleared session context
    - Fixed issue where switching loaded models on Windows would take several seconds
    - Running /save will no longer abort the chat session if an incorrect name is provided
    - The /api/tags API endpoint will now correctly return an empty list [] instead of null if no models are provided
