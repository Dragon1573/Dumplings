    Note for administrators using the convenience MSI installer file – The prerequisites for the Genesys Cloud Windows application changed with this update. These prerequisites must be installed before the application is updated. .NET Framework 4.8 and Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable runtime version of at least 14.38.33135 must be installed. These are installed automatically, if necessary, by the EXE installer provided but the MSI file doesn’t have this ability.
