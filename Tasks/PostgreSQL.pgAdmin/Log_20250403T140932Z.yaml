    Features:
    - Added an ability to configure the font family for SQL editors.

    - Added support for post-connection SQL execution, which will be run automatically on each connection made to any database of the server.

    - Added support for creating Directory nodes in EPAS.
    - Change icon buttons to show tooltips even when disabled.
    - Add an option to load/replace the servers.json file on each container startup.
    - Open user management in a separate tab instead of a dialog to enhance UI/UX.
    Bugs/Housekeeping:
    - Fixed an XSS vulnerability issue in the Query Tool and View/Edit Data (CVE-2025-2946).
    - Fixed a remote code execution issue in the Query Tool and Cloud Deployment (CVE-2025-2945).
    - Ensure that modal dialogs are not triggered more than once to avoid duplicates.

    - Fixed an issue where the PSQL terminal displays keyname for non-alphanumeric keys.
    - Change the stop/terminate icon at all the places for better UX.
    - Fixed an issue where the query tool data grid did not respect the default value for columns of domain type when the domain had a default value.
    - Ensure the newly added parameters in the server dialog are incorporated into the Import/Export Servers functionality.
    - Fixed an issue where the query tool is crashing on macOS 15.4 due to a locale issue.
    - Fixed an issue where the upgrade_check API returned an unexpected keyword argument 'cafile' due to changes in the urllib package supporting Python v3.13.
