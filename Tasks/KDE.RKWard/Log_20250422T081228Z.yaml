  Value: |-
    - Fixed: Crash when trying to edit a data.frame containing columns that are not vectors
    - Fixed: Basic statistics would refuse to "overwrite file", even if saving to file was unchecked
    - Changed: Status indicator for preview windows (updating/ready) is less obstrusive
    - Added: Ability to open PDF documents inside the RKWard window, and associated R function rk.show.pdf()
    - Fixed: Add breeze icons as a fallback on systems that use a different icon theme (fixes missing icons)
    - Added: Setup dialog includes setting to select a different R installation
    - Added: Command line option "--setup" to force (re-)initialization as if a new version of RKWard had been installed
    - Fixed: R functions loadhistory(), savehistory(), and timestamp() broken
    - Changed: R shared library is now loaded, dynamically, rather than linked at compile time.
               This allows more flexibility on which R version to use at runtime, esp. in the context of AppImage binaries

    - Fixed: Creating new output window from the UI would sometimes show empty window

    - Fixed: Added REUSE license information where missing
    - Fixed: Handling of carriage returns in R Console window (used in progress bars, importantly)
    - Fixed: Crash when renaming top level object from context menu
    - Changed: First version to be based on Qt6/KF6
