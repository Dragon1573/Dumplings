    GoLand 2025.2 EAP 3 is now available!
    This GoLand release introduces UI/UX enhancements and bug fixes:
    - GO-18129: the Welcome screen is now non-blocking and opens as a tab, allowing you to quickly access built-in tools like the terminal, Docker, Kubernetes, VCS, and databases without creating a project. We hope this change will improve workflows for DevOps and infrastructure tasks.
    - GO-18068: fixed an issue where handlers from standard and third-party HTTP routers were not appearing in the Endpoints tool window.
    This release also includes several minor updates and bug fixes. For the full list of improvements, see the release notes.
