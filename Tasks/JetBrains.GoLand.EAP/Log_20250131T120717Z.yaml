    GoLand 2025.1 EAP 3 is now available!
    This GoLand release addresses several key issues:
    - GO-15841: Notifications and handling for the toolchain directive have been improved. GoLand now shows a notification when the project's SDK is changed due to go or toolchain directives in go.mod. Additionally, the codebase now handles this directive more reliably.
    - GO-17509: GoLand no longer includes the deprecated -d flag when running go get, avoiding the -d flag is deprecated. -d=true is a no-op message in the Run tool window.
    - GO-17970: GoLand now properly recognizes the tool directive in go.mod files for Go 1.24 and higher, and it displays relevant errors, such as when the directive is unsupported by the current Go SDK.
    Please see the release notes for the complete list of fixes and improvements.
