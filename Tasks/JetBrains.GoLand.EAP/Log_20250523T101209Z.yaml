    GoLand 2025.2 EAP 2 is now available!
    This GoLand release introduces enhancements to static analysis for Go code:
    - GO-17763: GoLand now includes a new inspection that detects potential nil dereference issues using interprocedural data flow analysis. The Interprocedural potential nil dereference inspection identifies possible nil dereferences across function calls, even when those calls span multiple files or packages. It analyzes the entire call graph, with some limitations.
      To further aid our users in identifying unsafe pointer operations, we have also added a Nilability info section to the Quick Documentation popup. This section appears for functions with pointer-type parameters or those that might return nil.
    This release also includes several minor updates and bug fixes. For the full list of improvements, see the release notes.
