    GoLand 2025.2 EAP 1 is now available!
    This GoLand release introduces new functionality and improvements:
    - GO-2265: GoLand now supports the Duplicate code inspection for Go functions. This inspection identifies repeated logic across your codebase, helping you refactor and keep your code clean.
    - GO-17536: GoLand now displays helpful gutter icons in go.mod and Go files to simplify setting up database connections. These icons appear next to known database packages like jackc/pgx or go-sql-driver/mysql, letting you open the database connection dialog with a single click.
    - GO-15446: a new intention action in go.mod lets you merge consecutive require or replace statements into a single block. This works just like the Merge declaration up intention action in Go source files for var and const.
    - GO-7024: GoLand now offers code completion for Go constants by their values. For example, typing http.204 or http.Status204 will suggest http.StatusNoContent. This makes it easier to find and use symbolic constant names when only the numeric value is known.
    - GO-10293: GoLand now uses goimports-style import grouping by default.
    The release also includes other minor updates and bug fixes. For the full list of fixes and improvements, please check the release notes.
