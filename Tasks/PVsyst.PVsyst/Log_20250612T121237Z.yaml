    * Improvements

    - Demo projects: new demo commercial project
    - Databases update
    - Economic evaluation: "Production variation (aging)" is renamed to "Module degradation" and now only positive values are allowed
    - Economic evaluation: optimizers are now handled in the installation costs
    - Optimizers, SolarEdge and Sungrow: database update
    - Power Factor: update and clarification of the help page
    - Report: grid limitation mode is now displayed when applied
    - Report: module PAN file name displayed when custom
    - System design: overload losses are now adjusted when a Power Factor is specified in "energy management" (*)
    - System Sizing: Warning messages for inverters slightly or strongly undersized are now triggering above 2% and 4% overload losses, respectively. These errors are not fatal anymore (*).

    * Corrections

    - 3D scene: the number of modules per table are now correctly computed when importing a H2P file
    - 3D scene: the bottom cell size is now taken into account also when computing the shading factor table from the Near shadings window (*)
    - 3D scene: display of the 3D scene works correctly with missing ground image and generating a report no longer causes crashes
    - 3D scene: shading factor tables calculation is now faster on large scenes
    - 3D scene: DAE/PVC files with complex objects are now imported faster
    - Bifacial: corrected calculation of the sky diffuse contribution on the rear side of the PV modules (*)
    - Bifacial: saving PRBifi no longer causes crashes
    - Detailed losses: dragging a point in the IAM curves no longer causes display issues
    - Detailed Results: the values of apparent and reactive energy in hourly graphs and monthly hourly table are now correct
    - Economic evaluation: corrected inconsistencies and display issues in the "Financial Parameters" section
    - Module layout: IV curves for non-relevant orientations are no longer shown
    - Optimizers: selecting modules with small Isc no longer causes crashes
    - Optimizers: minor corrections for AMPTstring optimizers
    - Orientation: azimuth limits are now properly enforced when using the visual tool to set table orientation
    - Shadings, diffuse: correction of diffuse shading loss calculation for low sun angles and average orientations
    - Self-consumption: daily hourly profile is now normalized and saved properly
    - System: when using power sharing, the contractual DC power limit of the inverter is now applied correctly.
