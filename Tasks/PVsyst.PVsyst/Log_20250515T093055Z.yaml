    * Improvements

    - Backtracking management tool: all tracker orientations are now displayed, including those in error
    - Bifacial: diffuse irradiance on the ground (DiffGnd) is now available for export
    - Bifacial: the bifacial performance ratio (PRBifi) now accounts for the bifaciality factor (*)
    - Bifacial: the default upper limit for the bifaciality factor has been increased to 98%
    - Databases update
    - Report: the bifacial performance ratio (PRBifi) is now displayed in the report and monthly tables (*)
    - Weather data: ability to choose the TGY data source when importing SolarAnywhere data (latest or 2023).

    * Corrections

    - 3D scene: negative values no longer appear in the "split" electrical shading tables when thin objects are present in the 3D scene
    - Bifacial: in mixed orientations subarrays, the rear mismatch losses now account for the mismatch factor from both orientations
    - General: an issue linked to remote file downloads no longer causes crashes
    - Grid storage, Weak grid islanding: the unused energy is now correctly accounted for when the grid is unavailable
    - Grid storage: buttons and values now update correctly when defining a self-consumption profile
    - Optimizers: minor update of the optimizers MPP choice under partial shadings with module layout shading model (*)
    - Orientation: cases where opposite azimuths were identified as the same orientation are now resolved
    - Report: importing a variant with valid results now keeps its related Site and Weather file names available to consult
    - Report: irradiance and Energy units defined in preferences are now used in the report
    - Report: predefined graph names are now properly translated
    - Report: the description of the medium voltage line is now correct
    - Weather data, Solargis: importing monthly data with a non-integer timezone (e.g., India with UTC+5:30) no longer causes crashes
    - Weather data, sub-hourly data import: looser verification whenever GHI average, min., max. are closer than 0.1 W/mÂ²
    - Weather data, sub-hourly data import: the end of hour detection now works even when the time stamp does not include the year
    - Weather data, Vaisala: TMY import now manages GHI data correctly
    - Weather data: API-related issue no longer causes crashes
    - Weather data: importing empty csv files no longer causes crashes
    - Weather data: selecting variables for monthly weather data computation no longer causes crashes.
