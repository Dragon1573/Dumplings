    * Improvements

    - 3D scene: GCR definition clarified in the help
    - Bifacial: all orientations with an error or warning are now reported
    - Bifacial: errors stemming from the irregularity of pitch or the average tracker axis are now warnings
    - Databases update.
    - Power Factor: The help pages and other explantations about the power factor have been rewritten and have been illustrated with graphics to clarify the concepts.
    - Shading: A message is now displayed upon exit of the 3D dialog when the Partial Shading Calc selection is less than 5% of the total area or less than 10 tables

    * Corrections

    - Backtracking: the number of trackers with a higher GCR is now recomputed upon changing the backtracking reference tracker
    - Bifacial: The calculation of the rear-side diffuse contribution for horizontal PV tables, and the corresponding loss diagram have been corrected (regression in V8.0.13)
    - Components, PAN file: the numerical value of Voc in the PV module definition window is no longer affected by numerical imprecision
    - Detailed Results: the absence of default variables for monthly plots no longer causes crashes
    - Shadings: "Print" output now processes all orientations
    - Shadings, thin objects: the partition model results in presence of thin objects have been corrected. This may impact the simulation results, by increasing the electrical shadings slightly in some cases (**).
    - Report: Fix for partial shading always reporting 100%
    - Report: the units of energy results are now correct
