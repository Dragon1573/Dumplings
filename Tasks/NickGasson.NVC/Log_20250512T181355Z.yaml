    This is a minor bug fix release:
    - Fixed an elaboration failure where generic names differ in case between entity and component and the files were analysed with --preserve-case (#1195).
    - Fixed a crash when expression coverage is enabled and a port is associated with a non-static expression (#1194).
    - Fixed a debug assertion failure when initialising an array with more than 2**32 elements (#1196).
    - Fixed a crash when concatenating unconstrained arrays of arrays (#1199).
