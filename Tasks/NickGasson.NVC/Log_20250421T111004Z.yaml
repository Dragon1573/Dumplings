    This is a major new release with the following changes:
    - Added support for PSL prev(), stable(), rose() and fell() built-in functions (#1135).
    - Signals can now be read and passed to subprograms during elaboration and the effective value is the default value associated with the signal. This behaviour is not defined by the LRM but matches all other simulators (#1144).
    - MSYS2 binary packages are no longer provided with releases as these become out-of-date too quickly. Windows users should instead download the self-contained MSI package.
    - The Ubuntu binary packages for releases now have predictable names without the git commit hash (#1131).
    - Improved error messages when design units have circular dependencies or depend on obsolete design units (#1152).
    - Toggle coverage count is displayed correctly for unreachable constant driven toggle bins and transitions from X are counted with --count-from-undefined instead of just U.
    - Added an experimental --preserve-case analysis option to retain the original spelling of VHDL identifiers (#723).
    -  --ieee-warnings is now a global option and should be placed before the -r command. Passing it to the -r command is still supported but deprecated and may not take effect in some situations (#1151).
    - Fixed a crash when a partial association in a port map has a conversion function (#1161).
    - Improved the formatting of the --help output.
    - The GitHub Action has been renamed from nickg/setup-nvc-ci to nickg/setup-nvc, although the old name should redirect to the new.
    - A Docker image was added at ghcr.io/nickg/nvc (#1165).
    - Unconstrained input ports can now be constrained by the result subtype of a conversion function (#1171).
    - Type marks are now allowed in the prefix of selected names in relaxed mode (#1173).
    - Added the nvc.random random number generation package and --seed argument for deterministic results.
    - Added support for PSL union operator (from @Blebowski).
    - The implementation of concatenations has been reworked fixing several bugs (#1178).
    - Added support for conditional force assignment (#1185).
    - Access and file types are now supported in VHPI (#1192).
    - Fixed a crash when open actual was used for formal parameter without default.
    - Several other minor bugs were resolved (#1174, #1159, #1177, #1191, #1188).
    Special thank you to @bpadalino, @tmeissner, @Blebowski, @amb5l, @m42uko, @a-panella, @cmarqu, @albydnc, @johonkanen, and @augustofg for sponsoring me!
