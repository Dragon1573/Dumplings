    This is a minor bug fix release:
    - Fixed a crash when an entity uses VHDL-2019 enhanced type generics and sub-elements of a port with a generic array type are associated individually (#1201).
    - Fixed an issue where some generate statements were inaccessible from VHPI (#1213).
    - Several other minor bugs were resolved (#1202, #1204, #1212).
    Special thank you to @bpadalino, @tmeissner, @Blebowski, @amb5l, @m42uko, @a-panella, @cmarqu, @albydnc, @johonkanen, and @augustofg for sponsoring me!
