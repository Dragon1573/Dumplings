    - General:
      - When loading profiles, the SSH Client now strips whitespace at the start of most strings, including Unicode whitespace.
      - The SSH Client's installation directory path hijack check can now be disabled by configuring the DWORD value DisableInstDirCheck, with value 1, under the Windows registry key HKLM\Software\WOW6432Node\Bitvise. This also disables the check in recent versions of Bitvise SSH Server.
    - Proxy support:
      - When configured to connect via an HTTP CONNECT proxy, the SSH Client now sends an HTTP/1.1 request, including a Host header. Previous versions sent an HTTP/1.0 request (no Host header).
    - Graphical SFTP:
      - Cut-and-paste in the Local files pane can now move local files across drives and filesystem volumes. Directories cannot be moved in this manner.
      - The Filter feature in the Local files and Remote files panes now applies to both files and directories. Previously, it would filter only files.
      - Fixed additional issues in reporting of final size and reused bytes when using synchronization.
ReleaseTime: 2025-06-02
