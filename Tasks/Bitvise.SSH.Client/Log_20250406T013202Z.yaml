    - Installation:
      - When installing the FlowSshNet library component, the SSH Client installer now specifies the full path to msiexec.exe in the Windows System32 directory. This is to avoid running any unintended executable also named msiexec.exe which may have been placed in the same directory as the installer.
        On a system with multiple users, administrators should never run executables from a directory where a non-administrator user can write files outside of the administrator's control.
    - SFTP:
      - In the sftpc command-line client, the remote directory listing commands dir and ls, and the local versions ldir and lls, now support parameters to group directories and files separately, sort by name, sort by time, or reverse sorting order.
ReleaseTime: 2025-04-06
