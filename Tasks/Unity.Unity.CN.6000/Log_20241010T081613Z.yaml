    Known Issues in 6000.0.18f1
    - Android: Error in onPixelCopyFinished after updrading to Unity 6 (UUM-79451)
    - Asset - Database: Crash on MonoBehaviour::Transfer when the XR Interaction Toolkit Sample Assets are updated (UUM-76934)
    - DirectX12: Crash on BufferD3D12::BeginWrite when enabling water exclusion in the Underwater sample scene (UUM-77863)
    - DirectX12: Crash on GfxDeviceD3D12Base::DrawBuffersCommon when opening a project after changing the Graphics API to DirectX12 (UUM-77757)
    - Graphics Optimization Systems: Shader errors in DXC when building an empty URP project for Windows platform on a MacOS machine (UUM-78665)
    - Lighting: Block compression leads to lightbaking artifacts in HDRP (UUM-74735)
    - SRP Core: [URP 3D Sample] Light rendering artifacts visible in Universal 3D Sample Template. It seems to be that Shader Graphs/Screen_Graph is causing the issue. Disabling objects with this material will no longer reproduce light artifacts.
