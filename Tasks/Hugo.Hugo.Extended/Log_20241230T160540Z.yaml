    The timing of this release comes from the security fix in golang.org/x/net's html.Parse function. This is used in two places in Hugo:
    1. Extracting table of contents from Asciidoctor rendered output.
    2. Collecting HTML classes etc. when build stats is enabled
    It's a little bit of a stretch to see how this could be exploited in Hugo, but we understand that many want a clean security report. See this issue for details.
