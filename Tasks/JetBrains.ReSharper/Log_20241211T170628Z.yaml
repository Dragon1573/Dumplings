    ReSharper 2024.3.2
    Due to a technical issue, this update is numbered 2024.3.2, bypassing the 2024.3.1 release. Rest assured, it includes all the updates and fixes you would expect from the first release in the 2024.3 series.

    - Calls to extension methods using the new params collections feature in .NET 9 are no longer marked as errors. [RSRP-499333]
    - The params ReadOnlySpan<> overload is now correctly chosen when resolving method calls in .NET 9. [RSRP-499440]
    - The Cannot resolve symbol error for primary constructor parameters passed to the base constructor in WPF applications has been fixed. [RSRP-498553]
    - Extension methods in collection expressions are now resolved correctly, eliminating errors for valid Add method calls. [RSRP-499430]
    - The Convert to local variable refactoring no longer produces uncompilable code when fields are referenced with a this qualifier. [RSRP-400659]
    ReSharper C++ 2024.3.2
    - Links to invoke Visual Studio's actions, like Memory Layout and Search Online, are now also shown in ReSharper's tooltips. [RSCPP-35405]
    - We've made sure the ClangFormat formatter uses proper line endings instead of always using LF. [RSCPP-36349]
