    Reworked continuous testing
    We've reworked the continuous testing workflow to improve usability:
    - Before: Each unit test session could be converted into a continuous testing session, which could lead to confusion when there are multiple sessions running.
    - Now: There is a single, separate continuous testing session. This change makes it easier to manage and understand your testing workflow.
    Continuous testing indicator
    ReSharper has a new icon/indicator for continuous testing. The icon shows the current testing state, including whether there are any failed tests. In addition, it provides several quick actions: enabling or disabling continuous testing, viewing coverage results, toggling code highlighting, and more.
