    Added
    - Support for TES IV: Oblivion Remastered.
      - Oblivion Remastered uses a similar load order system to Skyrim (not Skyrim Special Edition), so LOOT will similarly read and write a loadorder.txt in the same directory as Plugins.txt.
      - Like OpenMW, Oblivion Remastered does not force master plugins to load before other plugins: all plugins are treated as non-masters.
    - The tables in the plugin metadata editor's Load After, Requirements and Incompatibilities tabs have gained a Constraint column as part of supporting v0.26 of the metadata syntax.
    Fixed
    - Plugin validity checks did not consider filter patches' embedded Bash Tags, so LOOT would incorrectly display errors about missing masters for them.
    - A crash could occur when creating a game handle for an OpenMW install that does not define any user config paths. An error now occurs instead. Via libloot.
    - The description_contains() metadata condition function did not read the description field of OpenMW plugins. Via libloot.
    Changed
    - Official LOOT releases now require the MSVC 2022 redistributable, which LOOT's installer will automatically download and install if necessary.
    - Skyrim VR and Fallout 4 VR now default to the same masterlist sources as Skyrim SE and Fallout 4 respectively, as their masterlists have been merged.
    - LOOT now supports v0.26 of the metadata syntax.
    - Updated fmt to v11.1.14.
    - Updated libloot to v0.26.1.
    - Updated Qt to v6.9.0.
    - Updated spdlog to v1.15.2.
    - Updated ValveFileVDF to v1.1.1.
    - Updated the Bulgarian translation.
    - Updated the German translation.
    - Updated the Portuguese translation.
    - Updated the Russian translation.
    Removed
    - File metadata display names are no longer quoted in messages.
    - Paths in condition strings are no longer restricted to staying within the directory tree that starts one level above the gameâ€™s main plugins directory (usually the Data directory). Via libloot.
    - The audio permission from LOOT's Flatpak manifest, as it was unused.
