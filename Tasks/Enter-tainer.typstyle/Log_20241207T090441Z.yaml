    - Typstyle will format binary expressions as operator chains. Parentheses are added if necessary.
    - Formatting chains with comments is supported now. This is the last piece of formatting with comments.
    - Dot chains in markup with parentheses will be broken into multiple lines, if the it contains at least two dots and one function calls.
    For example, the following code:
    #let _is_block(e,fn)=fn==heading or (fn==math.equation and e.block) or (fn==raw and e.has("block") and e.block) or fn==figure or fn==block or fn==list.item or fn==enum.item or fn==table or fn==grid or fn==align or (fn==quote and e.has("block") and e.block)
    Will be formatted as this in previous versions:
    #let _is_block(e, fn) = (
      fn == heading or (fn == math.equation and e.block) or (
        fn == raw and e.has("block") and e.block
      ) or fn == figure or fn == block or fn == list.item or fn == enum.item or fn == table or fn == grid or fn == align or (
        fn == quote and e.has("block") and e.block
      )
    )
    Now it will be formatted as:
    #let _is_block(e, fn) = (
      fn == heading
        or (fn == math.equation and e.block)
        or (fn == raw and e.has("block") and e.block)
        or fn == figure
        or fn == block
        or fn == list.item
        or fn == enum.item
        or fn == table
        or fn == grid
        or fn == align
        or (fn == quote and e.has("block") and e.block)
    )
