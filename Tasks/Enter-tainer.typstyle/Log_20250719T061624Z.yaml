    - Due to ci configuration issues, we failed to publish v0.13.15. This release is a re-publish of v0.13.15 with the correct version number.
    v0.13.15 - [2025-07-18]
    - Feature(CLI): Add --diff option to show unified diff of formatting changes. This allows users to preview what changes would be made before applying formatting.
      For example:
      typstyle file.typ --diff
      Output:
      --- file.typ
      +++ file.typ
      @@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
      -#let x=1+2
      -#let y=(3*4)
      +#let x = 1 + 2
      +#let y = (3 * 4)
    - Feature: Improve comment handling - line comments are now treated as line suffixes instead of separate lines, resulting in more compact and natural formatting.
      For example, The following code will be accepted by typstyle now:
      #let result = (x + y) / 2 + 1  // This comment stays on same line
      But it will be formatted to this in previous versions. Note that the comment was moved to a new line, which is not ideal for inline comments.
      // line width = 40
      #let result = (
        (x + y) / 2 + 1
      )  // This comment stays on same line
    - Feature: Add support for sharing links in the web playground, making it easier to share formatted code snippets with others for demo or collaboration.
    - Performance: Bump prettyless to v0.3.0. This slightly improves performance and lowers memory consumption during formatting.
