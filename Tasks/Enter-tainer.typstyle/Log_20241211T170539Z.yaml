    - Fix: musl build is now statically linked. This fixes the issue that the musl build doesn't work on systems other than alpine.
    - Typstyle now break content blocks into multiple lines if they have leading spaces and trailing spaces.
    For example, the following code is not formattable by typstyle previously:
    #{
      let res = if true [ The Result is definitely true. And it is a very long sentence that needs to be broken into multiple lines. ] else [ The Result is definitely false. And it is a very long sentence that needs to be broken into multiple lines. ]
    }
    Now it will be formatted as:
    #{
      let res = if true [
        The Result is definitely true. And it is a very long sentence that needs to be broken into multiple lines.
      ] else [
        The Result is definitely false. And it is a very long sentence that needs to be broken into multiple lines.
      ]
    }
