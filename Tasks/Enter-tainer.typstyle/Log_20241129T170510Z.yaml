    - Typstyle can format comments appears in most places. Previously it simply gives up when it encounters comments in these places. Now it can format them correctly.
    For example, this code:
    #let conf(
      title: none,   //comments
      authors:      (),
      abstract: [],
      lang: "zh",   // language
      doctype: "book",  //comments
      doc  // my docs
    ) = {
        doc }
    Previously typstyle will not format it. Now it will be formatted as:
    #let conf(
      title: none, //comments
      authors: (),
      abstract: [],
      lang: "zh", // language
      doctype: "book", //comments
      doc, // my docs
    ) = {
      doc
    }
    However, there are still some limitations. For more information, see Limitation.
    - Fix typstyle previously would format parenthesized patterns incorrectly into none. Now it is fixed.
