    - Bug fix: #272. Previously, typstyle will remove the space between variable and underscore in math equations. \(#mysum _(i=0)\) for example, will be formatted as \(#mysum_(i=0)\). Now it is fixed.
    - Enhancement: #273. When formatting math equations with alignments and multiline cells, previous typstyle versions will introduce excessive spaces. Now it is fixed.
    - Enhancement: #280. When wrap text is enabled, previous typstyle will mess up the formatting of labels. Now it is fixed.
