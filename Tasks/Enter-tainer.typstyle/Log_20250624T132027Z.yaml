  Value: |-
    - Feature(CLI): (breaking) Removed deprecated format-all command from CLI. This command was previously deprecated and has now been completely removed. Users should use typstyle <dir> -i instead.
    - Feature(CLI): Added --timing option to CLI for displaying elapsed time during formatting operations. Users can now monitor the performance of formatting operations with this new debug flag.
    - Feature: Empty code blocks no longer get extra spaces added.
      For example, #{} will now be formatted as #{} instead of #{ }. This aligns with the behavior of most code formatters.
    - Enhancement: Labels are no longer reflowed to the next line with text wrapping enabled.
    - Bug fix: Texts spanning multiple lines, such as strings, inline raws, or syntax nodes marked typstyle off are correctly layouted according to their line widths.
    - Bug fix: When the last arg of func call is not combinable, the flavor is respect.
