    - Updated UltiMaker S8 profiles to significantly improve the quality of PC, CPE, CPE+, PETG, support structures, and dual extrusion prints
    - Support brims no longer listen to the Brim Distance setting, so the brims will always be attached to the support
    - Fixed a bug affecting multi-extruder printers where the initial temperature was not set correctly at the start of a print if all features used an extruder other than T0
