    New Features
    - Deprecation notice about moving core resource packs to their individual gems after the next major release (#7219)
    - Added the --legacy flag to the inspec automate upload command. (#7200)
      The inspec automate upload command runs inspec check and inspec export, which were updated in Chef InSpec 5.22.36. This update led to a bug with InSpec profiles with =begin =end.
      Use the --legacy flag with profiles where the newer export and check methods may fail to parse older profiles correctly, particularly due to limitations in AST parsing.
