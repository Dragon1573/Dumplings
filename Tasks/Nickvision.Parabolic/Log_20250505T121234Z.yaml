    After a long wait, Parabolic V2025.5.0 is finally here!
    This release contains a complete redesign of the Windows (Qt based) app that features a much more modern experience. yt-dlp was also updated to the latest version to fix many website validation issues.
    NOTICE
    As you may have seen, development of Parabolic and the set of Nickvision apps has slowed down. This is due to me starting a new full-time job and thus leaving only the weekends for me to work on these projects. This does not mean I am stopping development, it just means that releases, updates, and fixes will unfortunately take longer now. I appreciate all of your support and patience for these updates. Any C++ developers who would like to work on the projects with me as well are more than welcome too and are encouraged to reach out to me on Matrix!
