    IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1.2 is out with the following improvements:
    - The IDE no longer fails to start if a plugin defines an action with unresolved message bundle keys, and it now provides a report identifying the problematic plugin. [IJPL-185981]
    - The IDE no longer produces the false positive "Package is declared in module which is not in the module graph" warning. [IDEA-371051]
    - The IDE once again correctly takes compilerArgs from pom.xml into account when building Maven projects. [IDEA-371747]
    - Font size rescaling for the Quick Documentation popup works as expected. [IJPL-184559]
    - Inspections in Terraform can now be suppressed again. [IJPL-149116]
