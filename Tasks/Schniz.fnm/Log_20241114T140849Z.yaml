    Minor Changes
    - #1265 186e4bb Thanks @Schniz! - enable --resolve-engines by default. out of experimental phase.
      to disable it, add a --resolve-engines=false flag, and make sure to open an issue describing why. It might feel like a breaking change but .nvmrc and .node-version have precedence so it should not.
      I am all in favor of better experience and I believe supporting engines.node is a good direction.
