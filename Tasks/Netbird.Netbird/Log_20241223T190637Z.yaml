    Release notes
    With this release, we are introducing a new concept in NetBird called Networks. This concept improves the administration of routed resources and provides greater visibility into what is shared with peers. Networks are configuration containers that map your on-premise or cloud networks in a logical set of configurations, making it easier to manage and share routes with your peers based on your infrastructure.
    Support for Networks will be available for our cloud-hosted systems in the next few days.
    You can find out more information about Networks here: Concept Routing traffic to multiple IP resources Accessing restricted website domain resources Accessing entire domains within networks

    Multiple resource types and new support for wildcard domains:
