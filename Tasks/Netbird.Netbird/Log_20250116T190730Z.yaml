    Release notes
    This release introduces initial support to QUIC as a protocol for relay servers, MySQL support for store, and rootless container support for the client running Netstack mode. We also added support for disabling system flags in the client, and optional ZITADEL PAT configuration in the management service among other enhancements and bug fixes.
    New features
    QUIC Protocol Support
    Added initial support for the QUIC protocol in the client and relay server, improving connection reliability and performance. For self-hosted admins that want to try this out, you should ensure that the relay server has TLS certificates configured and that the main listening port is available in both, TCP and UDP.
    Rootless Container Support
    Implemented rootless container support for the client running in Netstack mode, enabling secure and compatible operation without requiring privileged permissions or Linux capabilities.
    You can use the images netbirdio/netbird:rootless-latest or netbirdio/netbird:0.36.0-rootless for this mode.
    Learn more about how to enable Netstack mode in the documentation.
    MySQL Support
    Added MySQL support for the management service, allowing users to store data in a MySQL database. This feature is particularly useful for organizations that prefer MySQL as their database backend.
    If you want to start a new deployment with MySQL, you can use the environment variable NETBIRD_STORE_CONFIG_ENGINE=mysql and NETBIRD_STORE_ENGINE_MYSQL_DSN="<username>:<password>@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/<database>" in the setup.env file.
    We are counting on your feedback and community contributions to improve documentation for this support.
    Enhancements
    New system flags to disable a few features on the client side
    We are introducing a set of new flags that allow users to disable specific features on the client side. This is particularly useful for users who wants more control over their system configurations.
    The new flags are available with the netbird up command, see the flags below:
    --disable-client-routes           Disable client routes. If enabled, the client won't process client routes received from the management service.
          --disable-dns                     Disable DNS. If enabled, the client won't configure DNS settings.
          --disable-firewall                Disable firewall configuration. If enabled, the client won't modify firewall rules.
          --disable-server-routes           Disable server routes. If enabled, the client won't act as a router for server routes received from the management service.
    Optional ZITADEL PAT Configuration
    Enabled optional configuration of a Personal Access Token (PAT) for ZITADEL in the management service, enhancing authentication options for users who want to use ZITADEL as their identity provider.
    To configure the ZITADEL PAT, you can use the environment variable NETBIRD_IDP_MGMT_EXTRA_PAT=<secret> in the setup.env file.
