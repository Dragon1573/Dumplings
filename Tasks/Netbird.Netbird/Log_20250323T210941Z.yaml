    What's New
    This release includes support for traffic events captured between peers and resources and other peers in the network. We are also adding support to the Redis cache for IDP data. This allows a more persistent cache across management restarts.
    Traffic events support (Cloud-only)
    Weâ€™ve made significant progress on network traffic observability by adding Traffic events support and enhancing event metadata. The updates include:

    - Traffic events support on client. #3414
    These changes help you gain deeper visibility into traffic flows within your network.
