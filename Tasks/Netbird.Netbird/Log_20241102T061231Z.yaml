    Highlights
    [management] Setup key improvements #2775
    - We added support to setup-key deletion, allowing account cleanup of revoked or expired keys.
    - The max expiration time was removed, allowing users to define any date for key expiration.
    - Setup-keys are now stored as hashs, improving security for systems.
    Because of a database migration where the setup-keys are being hashed, a downgrade is no longer possible without restoring a backup. So, testing and making sure a backup is done before upgrading is highly recommended. See backup docs here: https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/selfhosted-guide#backup
