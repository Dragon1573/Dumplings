    BREAKING CHANGES:
    - template: Support for the following non-hermetic sprig functions has been removed: sprig_date, sprig_dateInZone, sprig_dateModify, sprig_htmlDate, sprig_htmlDateInZone, sprig_dateInZone, sprig_dateModify, sprig_randAlphaNum, sprig_randAlpha, sprig_randAscii, sprig_randNumeric, sprig_randBytes, sprig_uuidv4, sprig_env, sprig_expandenv, and sprig_getHostByName. [GH-25998]
    SECURITY:
    - identity: Fixed bug where workflow identity policies are matched by job ID prefix (CVE-2025-4922) [GH-25869]
    - template: Bump the consul-template version to resolve CVE-2025-27144, CVE-2025-22869, CVE-2025-22870 and CVE-2025-22872. [GH-25998]
    - template: Removed support to the non-hermetic sprig_env, sprig_expandenv, and sprig_getHostByName sprig functions to prevent potential leakage of environment or network information, since they can allow reading environment variables or resolving domain names to IP addresses. [GH-25998]
    IMPROVEMENTS:
    - cli: Added job start command to allow starting a stopped job from the cli [GH-24150]
    - client: Add gc_volumes_on_node_gc configuration to delete host volumes when nodes are garbage collected [GH-25903]
    - client: add ability to set maximum allocation count by adding node_max_allocs to client configuration [GH-25785]
    - host volumes: Add -force flag to volume delete command for removing volumes from GC'd nodes [GH-25902]
    - identity: Allow ACL policies to be applied to a namespace [GH-25871]
    - ipv6: bind and advertise addresses are now made to adhere to RFC-5942 ยง4 (reference: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5952.html#section-4) [GH-25921]
    - reporting (Enterprise): Added support for offline utilization reporting [GH-25844]
    - template: adds ability to specify once mode for job templates [GH-25922]
    - wi: new API endpoint for listing workload-attached ACL policies [GH-25588]
    BUG FIXES:

    - client: Fixed a bug where disconnect.stop_on_client_after timeouts were extended or ignored [GH-25946]
    - csi: Fixed -secret values not being sent with the nomad volume snapshot delete command [GH-26022]
    - disconnect: Fixed a bug where pending evals for reconnected allocs were not cancelled [GH-25923]
    - driver: Allow resources.cpu values above the maximum cpu.share value on Linux [GH-25963]
    - job: Ensure sidecar task volume_mounts are added to planning diff object [GH-25878]
    - reconnecting client: fix issue where reconcile strategy was sometimes ignored [GH-25799]
    - scaling: Set the scaling policies to disabled when a job is stopped [GH-25911]
    - scheduler: Fixed a bug where a node with no affinity could be selected over a node with low affinity [GH-25800]
    - scheduler: Fixed a bug where planning or running a system job with constraints & previously running allocations would return a failed allocation error [GH-25850]
    - telemetry: Fix excess CPU consumption from alloc stats collection [GH-25870]
    - telemetry: Fixed a bug where alloc stats were still collected (but not published) if telemetry.publish_allocation_metrics=false. [GH-25870]
    - ui: Fix incorrect calculation of permissions when ACLs are disabled which meant actions such as client drains were incorrectly blocked [GH-25881]
