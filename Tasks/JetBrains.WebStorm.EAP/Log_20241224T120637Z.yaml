    What's fixed:
    - We've fixed the search in the node_modules folder with the Search in library files... option disabled so appropriate search results are no longer missed (WEB-70620).
    - The *.iml file in generated projects is now placed within the project folder, as expected (WEB-70221).
    - We've fixed crashes of the JavaScript Debugger in WASM projects (WEB-70558).
    - We've made Git integration friendlier by removing a misleading notification that appeared when Git GPG signing failed (IJPL-173525).
    - We've fixed the problem with the IDE restarting infinitely on attempting to change the region or language (IJPL -172535).
    - We've fixed the problem with the localization language remaining unchanged after choosing another one (IJPL -173465).
    For more details, please see the release notes.
