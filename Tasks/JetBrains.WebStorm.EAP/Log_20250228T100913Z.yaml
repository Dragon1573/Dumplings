    - We've fixed RXJS type inference on using tap() in Angular applications ( WEB-71482).
    - We've improved Angular support getting rid of duplicated Unresolved pipe messages (WEB -71557).
    - We've implemented resolution for the @ViewChild selector inside control flow blocks (WEB-71756).

    - We've implemented recognition of style bindings units in Angular applications (WEB -71777).
    - We've extended the context menu of a folder with an option to mark the folder as excluded or non-excluded (WEB-70418).
    - We've added a Dynamic usages filter to the Find tool window and to the popup so text and string usages can be filtered out from the list of search results (WEB-67677).

    - We've fixed the problem with switching to another language in the Remote Development mode so that both the frontend and the backend are restarted with the new language (IJPL-178315).
    - We've revised and reworked DispatcherMain (IJPL-178581, IJPL-175288, IJPL-166436).
    - The REST Client response handler regex no longer fails (IJPL-178534).
    - We've improved the appearance and behavior of editor tabs with the Show pinned tabs in a separate row option enabled so tabs no longer bounce if there is not enough (IJPL-178708).
