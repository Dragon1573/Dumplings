    - We've added support for Source Phase Imports in ECMAScript (WEB-66664).
    - We've added support for the import defer syntax (WEB-69587).
    - We've fixed the problem with sharing linked projects on GitHub in the Multiple Projects Workspace mode ( IJPL-177374).
    - The Recent Files switcher now works properly via the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in the Remote Development mode (IJPL-177136).
    - Settings specified on Settings | Languages & Frameworks | Markdown are now properly saved and applied in the Remote Development mode (IJPL-165703).
    - We've fixed the appearance and behavior of the cursor in the Reworked Terminal so that the cursor is displayed double-width wide when it is positioned at a double-width wide character (IJPL-176138).
