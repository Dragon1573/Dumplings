    Rider 2025.1 EAP 6 comes with the following updates:
    New Detach button for C++ debugging
    Rider now offers a Detach button when debugging C++ applications. You can now detach from a running C++ process without terminating it, allowing the application to continue executing independently.
    The Detach button can be found in the Run/Debug menu during the debugging of C++ applications or on the toolbar of the Debugger tool window.
    String interpolation support in the Decompiler tool window
    Support for C# string interpolation is now available in the decompiler, making the output more readable and aligned with modern C# best practices.
    The decompiler will now automatically transform string.Concat and string.Format calls into C# string interpolation where applicable.
    For full information about the updates included in this build, please see our issue tracker.
