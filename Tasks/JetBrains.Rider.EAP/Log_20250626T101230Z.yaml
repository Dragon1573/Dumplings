    Rider 2025.2 EAP 7 comes with:
    Low-level exception suppression for C++ and game development
    You can now suppress low-level exceptions and signals triggered by manual breakpoints like int3 across all platforms. This gives you more control when debugging C++ game projects and lets you skip over certain asserts without constantly resuming execution.
    Read the blog post for all the details.
