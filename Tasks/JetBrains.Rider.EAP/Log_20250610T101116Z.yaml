    Rider 2025.2 EAP 4 comes with:
    SQL project support via bundled plugin
    Rider now provides support for SQL database projects via a bundled plugin. The plugin works out of the box and delivers a smoother experience for working with SQL database projects. Key capabilities include:
    - Support for Microsoft.Build.Sql SDK-style projects
    - Project templates for creating new SDK-style SQL database projects
    - Schema comparison
    - Project publishing
    - Importing projects from a database
    - Adding database references
    C# support
    C# 14's null-conditional assignments
    Rider now provides initial support for a?.b = c and a?[i] = c syntax from C# 14, allowing you to write safer, more concise conditional assignments without explicit null checks.
    LoggerMessageAttribute refactoring
    When working with Microsoft.Extensions.Logging package, there's now a new context action to convert ILogger method calls into LoggerMessageAttribute-based methods for improved performance.
    Smarter ILogger<T> completion
    Now when you write ILogger<>, Rider will suggest the current type as a context-aware completion inside the angled brackets.
    inside the angled brackets.
