    Rider 2025.1 EAP 8 comes with the following updates:
    Remote development in Rider is moving to JetBrains Toolbox
    Starting with the 2025.1 release, remote development in Rider can now be managed through the JetBrains Toolbox App. While Gateway remains available for remote access to Linux machines, the transition to Toolbox has begun, with the goal of making it the primary access point for remote development in future releases.
    The latest Early Preview build for Toolbox introduces full remote development support, allowing you to connect to Windows, macOS, and Linux hosts, set up SSH access with OpenSSH, and keep all your projects in one place.
    For more details and a step-by-step guide, check out this blog post from the Toolbox team.
    Support for Azure Function projects
    Rider 2025.1 now supports running and debugging Azure Function projects via the .NET Aspire and the Azure Toolkit for Rider plugins. Please share any feedback you may have on the functionality in the comments to this ticket.
    Support for AWS Lambda Function projects in .NET Aspire
    The .NET Aspire plugin now also supports running and debugging AWS Lambda Function projects in Rider. For more information, please see this GitHub issue.
    For full information about the updates included in this build, please see our issue tracker.
