    Rider 2025.2 EAP 5 comes with:
    Reimagined Monitoring tool
    The EAP 5 build introduces an improved version of the Monitoring tool, designed to make performance optimization a breeze for .NET applications. New interactive charts visualize runtime performance while intelligent detection automatically flags bottlenecks and issues. One click takes you from a finding to the responsible piece of code, with the option of a full investigation through bundled dotTrace and dotMemory profilers.
    You can learn more on our blog.
    OpenTelemetry plugin for JetBrains Rider
    Get runtime observability without leaving your IDE! The new plugin brings logs, metrics, and traces directly into Rider. Click from any log entry straight to the responsible code, visualize performance metrics, and see auto-generated architecture diagrams based on your application's flow.
    This blog post has all the details.
    For the full list of changes included in this build, please see our issue tracker.
