    Rider 2024.2 EAP 9 is out with:
    More debugging performance improvements for Rider on macOS
    We have fixed an issue that caused slow debugger performance on macOS. This fix improved performance in various scenarios, including exception handling, code evaluation, conditional breakpoints, and stepping, resulting in a smoother and more efficient debugging experience. Additionally, applications running under the debugger now execute more quickly, reducing overall testing and debugging time.
