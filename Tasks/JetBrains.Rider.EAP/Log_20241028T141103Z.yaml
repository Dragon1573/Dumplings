    Rider 2024.3 EAP 5 is out with:
    C# 13 field keyword support (preview features)
    Rider 2024.3 offers support for the field keyword. With the introduction of this keyword, instead of using separate field declarations for properties, you can now directly access the anonymous backing field inside the property accessors, simplifying property declarations, especially when validation, transformations, or computations are needed.
    Multiline TODO comments support
    Rider 2024.3 now supports multiline TODO comments, allowing indented text on subsequent lines to be treated as part of the same TODO item. This enhancement makes it easier to group related notes and tasks together in your codebase. You can now add context to your TODOs across multiple lines, improving readability and organization.
    Additionally, if you encounter a to-do item in code that links to an external issue, you can use Peek To-do link action (Ctrl+Shift+click) to display the issue inline.
    Code cleanup
    We've significantly reworked the internals of Code Cleanup modules responsible for applying quick-fixes, such as those used to remove code redundancies. This update aligns Code Cleanup with the same engine that powers the scoped application of quick-fixes. We've also enhanced the engine to ensure it fully resolves issues, addressing rare cases where scoped applications previously left additional suggestions unresolved. In addition, more code analyzers have been fine-tuned for greater granularity, building on the improvements introduced in Rider 2024.2. Finally, we implemented parallel preprocessing in Code Cleanup, which optimizes file processing for better performance.
    Freeze/Thaw individual threads during debugging
    Rider 2024.3 introduces the ability to freeze and thaw individual threads during debugging sessions for more precise control over multithreaded applications. This feature allows you to right-click on any thread and select Freeze to pause its execution without affecting the rest of the application. When you're ready, you can right-click again and select Thaw to resume the threadâ€™s execution.
    Support for primary constructors in the Decompiler
    When working with classes that declare a primary constructor, the Decompiler will now display the constructor and its parameters correctly, giving you a complete view of how objects are instantiated directly from the decompiled code.
