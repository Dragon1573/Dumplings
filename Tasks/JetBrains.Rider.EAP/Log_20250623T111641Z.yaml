    Rider 2025.2 EAP 6 comes with:
    Unity shader debugging with the new Frame Viewer plugin
    The new Frame Viewer plugin introduces source-level debugging for Unity shaders. Developers can inspect .rdc snapshots from RenderDoc, step through original ShaderLab code, set breakpoints, and analyze draw calls with vertex and pixel selection, texture previews, and shader-based filters.
    The Frame Viewer plugin is currently only available for Unity projects on Windows.
    Major update to GDScript support
    GDScript support has been significantly upgraded by integrating the former third-party plugin directly into Rider. This update resolves SDK initialization issues, fixes missing references like Globals, improves icon rendering, and eliminates reliance on insecure SDK downloads.
    Roslyn code completion support
    Support for Roslyn-based completions has been added. Analyzer packages using the CompletionProvider API can now deliver context-aware code suggestions through the Roslyn CompletionService, enabling richer completions for ASP.NET Core and custom project scenarios.
    The ability to pause all processes on a breakpoint
    Rider now includes an option to pause all attached native processes when a breakpoint is hit during multi-process debugging. This improves debugging consistency in complex scenarios, such as game development or distributed systems.
    You can enable this behavior by going to Settings/Preferences | Build, Execution, Deployment | Debugger and checking the Pause all native processes on breakpoint hit option.
    New UI styles: One Island vs Many Islands
    In the latest 2025.2 EAP of JetBrains IDEs, you can find two new UI styles: One Island and Many Islands, each available with both dark and light modes. Ultimately, one of these styles will become the new default â€“ your feedback will help us decide which one. More on that here.
