    Click here for the full list of .NET 8 updates and bug fixes weâ€™ll be delivering over the next couple of weeks leading up to the 2023.3 release.
    Additional updates in this EAP build include:
    - The data flow analysis (DFA) mode in the debugger has been renamed and is now called the predictive debugger.
    - We've made improvements to the experience of reviewing multiple iterations of analyzing a cycle with the predictive debugger. Cases where only one iteration is possible are now appropriately reflected in the UI [RIDER-89886].
    - We've also fixed static variable evaluation in the debugger in case of different AssemblyLoadContext classes [RIDER-96018].
    - Rider's ability to connect to MS SQL Server databases has now been restored.
    Known issues
    Hot Reload doesn't give warnings if changes could not be applied [RIDER-102058].
