    Rider 2025.2 EAP 3 comes with:
    Mixed-mode debugging for Unity on Windows x64
    You can now debug managed and native code side-by-side using Unity mixed-mode debugger support. The feature is technically implemented to support Mono mixed-mode debugging, so if you use Mono runtime outside of Unity the feature will also be useful for you. You can enable it in Unity or .NET project run configurations.
    All the features of both debuggers are supported and you can step into native code from managed code by stepping into "extern" methods.
    Hit count conditions for C++ breakpoints
    Rider's native debugger now supports hit count conditions for breakpoints in C++ code. You can set breakpoints to trigger only under specific conditions â€“ like on the 10th time it's hit, every 5th time, or after it's been hit 10 times total. This works across all supported native debuggers: LLDB, GDB, and DAP (PlayStation).
    C++ support
    You can now fold regions defined by // region and // endregion comments in C++ code for easier navigation and structure management.
    Notable fixes:
    We've resolved a long-standing issue where buttons in the Immediate window's toolbar would disappear when using the expression evaluation tab. [RIDER-121332]
    Fixes for Unity debugger
    Several issues affecting Unity debugging have been resolved in this build:
    - Performance improvements:
    - In most cases, the debugger pauses runtime much less frequently.
    - Breakpoints in generic classes and methods don't cause Rider and Unity to freeze.
    - Exception breakpoints are now processed more quickly and reliably.
    - The resume/suspend imbalance issue has been fixed.
    - An error is now reported when attempting to attach to Unity if it was left in an inconsistent state by a previous debugging session.
    You can explore each fix in more detail by going to this parent-ticket.
