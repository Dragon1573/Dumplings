    Rider 2024.1 EAP 9 comes with the following updates:
    AI
    When renaming a local variable, you will get name suggestions powered by AI in the code completion popup.
    Collection Visualizer
    You can now pin the Collection View window to the code editor as a tab using the pin icon on the right side of the toolbar.
    Debugger
    There is a new option to configure Just-In-Time compilation to deoptimize methods on step into and methods with breakpoints, and recompile them to improve stepping and code evaluation while debugging external code. This option is enabled by default. It only works on .NET 8 and higher, and only on Windows because of limitations in .NET 8.
    Publish
    Publish to Folder now supports publishing MAUI apps for all target platforms: Android, iOS, macOS, and MacCatalyst.
    Unreal Engine support
    Automation scripts are supported when opening .uproject files.
    Godot support
    The gdUnit4Mono unit test framework is now supported.
    Refactorings
    We've made several improvements to the Make Static refactoring as described on the ReSharper page.
    For the full list of changes included in this build, please refer to the issue tracker.
