    Rider 2024.2 EAP 8 is out
    The .NET Aspire plugin bundled
    The .NET 8 SDK introduced .NET Aspire – a new approach to tackling the complex issues around building distributed applications on the .NET stack. In response to this innovation, JetBrains introduced new integrated tooling – the .NET Aspire plugin for Rider.
    Starting with this build, the .NET Aspire plugin is now bundled with Rider. The plugin comes with a corresponding project template that you can select when setting up a new solution.
    For the full list of changes included in this build, please refer to our issue tracker.
