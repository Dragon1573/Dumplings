    Dear digiKam fans and users,
    After five months of active maintenance and many weeks triaging bugs, the digiKam team is proud to present version 8.5.0 of its open source digital photo manager.
    Generalities
    More than 160 bugs have been fixed and we spent a lot of time contacting users to validate changes in pre-release versions to confirm fixes before deploying the program to production.
    Application internationalization has also been updated. digiKam and Showfoto are released with 61 different languages for the graphical interface. Go to the Settings/Configure Languages dialog and change the localization as you want. digiKam needs to be restarted to apply the changes. If you want to contribute to the internationalization of digiKam, please contact the translator teams, following the translation how-to. The statistics about translation states are available here.
