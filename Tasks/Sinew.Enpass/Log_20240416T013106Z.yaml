    Hi Enpass fans!
    To help your transition to a passwordless future, Enpass now makes it easy to find accounts in your vaults that offer passkey security!
    Whatâ€™s New:
    - A new "Passkeys" section has been added in the "Others" section of the sidebar, showing all your Items with passkeys.
    - A new "Passkey Supported" section has been added in the "Audit" section of the sidebar, showing all your accounts where you could add passkey security.
    - For accounts that offer passkey security, the Item Details screen will now display a "Passkey Available" banner if no passkey is found for the account.
    - Former Dashlane users can now import data via CSV (as well as JSON).
    Fixes
    - Resolved "SSL certification failed" error when trying to complete registration from the Enpass Welcome screen.
    - Resolved a problem with Enpass not remembering the keyfile location when the app has been forced to quit.
    - When adding an email address to an Item, suggestions list will no longer include addresses from Items in your trash.
    - Passkey login is now working at vercel.com.
    - When moving an Item between vaults, if that Item belongs to a custom category, that category will now migrate with the Item.
    - No more problems displaying the '&' character in tags.
    - Resolved bug related to using Print dialog to save an Item as a PDF.
