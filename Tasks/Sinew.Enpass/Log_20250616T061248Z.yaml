    We’re back with a fresh update! This release brings new enhancements to improve troubleshooting, expanded autofill capabilities, and important fixes to boost your overall Enpass experience.
    Improvements
    - The Enpass extension can now autofill standalone TOTP (one-time code) fields on supported websites.
    Fixes
    - Fixed an issue where connecting multiple vaults to different Nextcloud accounts with the same username resulted in an ‘Authentication error’.
    - Fixed an issue where syncing or restoring a vault from iCloud did not redirect back to the app when Chrome was set as the default browser.
    - Fixed an issue where the Windows Hello option was getting disabled after locking and unlocking the app from the Settings page immediately after enabling Windows Hello.
    - Other minor bug fixes.
    For Enpass Business Users:
    - You can now create a secondary vault directly at the root of a SharePoint or shared drive without needing to create a folder beforehand.
    - If your organization has restricted secondary vault creation for certain locations, a user from a group with permissions to create and share vaults can still create the vault, allowing the restricted user to add and access it.
