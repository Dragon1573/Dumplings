    Issues Addressed in Foxit PDF Editor Subscription Release 2024.2.2.25170
    - Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to hidden dangers lurking in common tools when opening certain PDFs that include the Launch File action, which attackers could exploit to deceive users into executing harmful commands. This appears in the security warning dialog box as it shows “OK” as the default selected option, which may cause users to habitually click “OK” without understanding the potential risks involved.
    - Fixed other security and stability issues. Click here for details.
