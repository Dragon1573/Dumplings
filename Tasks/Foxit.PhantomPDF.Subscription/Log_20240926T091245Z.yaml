    New Features and Improvements in Foxit PDF Editor Subscription Release 2024.3.0.26795
    - Create organized PDF binders
      The Binder feature offers an efficient way to compile and organize multiple documents in different formats into a single file - a PDF binder, with the support of various customizations like TOC (table of contents) generation. Saving the compiled set as a binder project or a template preserves the entire binder structure, including the arrangement of documents, TOC, and any customizations made. This feature is useful for users such as legal professionals or sales representatives to easily consolidate multiple related documents into one cohesive presentation or report.
