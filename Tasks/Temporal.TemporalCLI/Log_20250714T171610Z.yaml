    New Commands
    - temporal workflow reset with-workflow-update-options runs Workflow Update Options (temporal workflow update-options) atomically after the Workflow is reset. This is useful for versioned workflows that have progressed on a buggy worker version and must be reset before they can move to and continue running on a version with the fix.
