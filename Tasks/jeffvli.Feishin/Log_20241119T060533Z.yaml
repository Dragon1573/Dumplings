    Maintenance Notice
    This release marks the last major feature release for Feishin. I started this project over 2 years ago as a rewrite of Sonixd, and I'm quite proud of how far it has come. I taught myself web development by building Sonixd, and rebuilt it as Feishin with the intention of using all of my learnings from trial and error to build a more polished desktop audio experience. With the support of all the contributors, I can proudly say that this project has become one of the go-to music players for self-hosting enthusiasts.
    With that said, I have a vision to bring an even better experience to the self-hosted audio landscape. Feishin is undergoing a full rewrite to audioling!
    For the tl;dr of what this encompasses:
    - Electron -> Tauri
    - Performance and UX improvements based on my learnings from Feishin
    - First-class support for the OpenSubsonic standard
    You can follow along with the progress by:
    - Joining the discord or matrix community servers
    - Dropping a follow or star on the audioling repository
    Feature and bugfix PRs will still be accepted for the time being!
    Thanks, Jeff
