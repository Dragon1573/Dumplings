  Value: |-
    🛠️ Fixes issue with SVG thumbnail handler (regression due to workaround for PowerToys SVG preview issue). I suggest using resvg instead. This update will try to detect it and purge OC's SVG cache. It can be controlled with the option in Settings-Advanced (bottom)
    🛠️ Taskmaster 0.9, option to set all file dates to original dates (set as default)
    🛠️ Rename not showing extension change dialog unless extension was completely removed. Dialog for this was also redesigned.
    🛠️ .ico files show the highest resolution icon. This update purges the .ico thumbnail cache so this can be seen
    🛠️ If Google Drive bugs-out and starts affecting OC performance, popup is shown offering to restart Google Drive
    🛠️ New window is created in size and position of the previous window (+offset)
    🛠️ Folder icons pngs applied to original name in addition to localized name
    🐞 Fixed jumplist (taskbar right-click menu) listing available windows
    🐞 Fixed splashscreen logo black background
    🐞 Fixed disabling option to Ctrl+V to paste as text; paste filename format is in 24h format
    🐞 Fixed RMB opening shortcut location if opencontaining is removed from Excluded menu list
    🐞 Fixed setting work directory for context menu items (affecting only a few)
    🛠️ New user defaults changed - Rename through Explorer dialogs is enabled, and showing file extensions
