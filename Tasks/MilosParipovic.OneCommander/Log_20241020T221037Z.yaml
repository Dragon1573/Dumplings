    🚀 Metadata in Preview/Details pane. See items like resolution for photos/videos, artist and other data for MP3, bookmarks and page count for PDFs, etc.
    🚀 Variable scroll speed during drag-n-drop operation. Files list auto-scrolls near the edge of the list. Scroll speed is slow near left edge, and fast near right edge. Scroll area indicators show up
    🛠️ Mousewheel over tabs to switch to previous/next. Note that this is not very responsive since OC relists all tab content on switch (it doesn't store the entire files list for tabs, so it doesn't consume memory even if you have 100 tabs, but this means switching tabs is not instant)
    🛠️ Closing last tab closes window (only in single-pane layout)
    🐞 Fixed issue with History pane having no items after a RDP connection
    🐞 Some non-critical bugfixes
