    The following new features and changes are included:
    - Buttons for copying results tables and diagrams.
    - Copy & Paste in the parts list now only copies the selected cells.
    - Specific CO2 emissions are set to 380 g/kWh.
    - Currents and voltages are now grouped during CSV export.
    - Guernsey and Jersey added to MeteoSyn country list.
    The following bugs have been fixed:
    - Error when averaging 10- and 15-minute values in *.csv export.
    - Crash when starting different PV*SOL variants and versions at the same time.
    - Crash when exiting the financial analysis parameter dialog if the term and repayment free initial period year were set to the same value.
    - Crash when simulating with bifacial modules and row spacing 0 m.
    - Opening the options for *.csv export did not force a new simulation when changing the time step.
    - Simulation progress dialog could no longer be closed with "Alt+F4".
    - Error in checking the charging power for electric vehicles.
    - Carpet plots in the project report are now prevented if simulation results are not available.
    - Rare crash in calculation of DC power of DC-coupled battery systems.
    - In some cases, the initialization file for the license management could not be deserialized.
    - Error when using tracker systems for locations in the southern hemisphere.
    - Display of the PV modules page in French, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian partially incorrect.
    - Changing the country of the climate data led to the deletion of the financial analysis data for off-grid systems.
    - The energy balance entries for power optimizers were not correctly labelled during *.csv export.
    - Crash when defining a new PV module if the current or voltage in the MPP was higher than the short-circuit current or open-circuit voltage.
    - Incorrect interpolation of power optimizer curves between negative and positive power consumption.
    - Crash when starting PV*SOL due to IPC timing problem.
    - When using battery systems with batteries based on lithium nickel manganese oxide, negative losses could occur in the battery.
    - Main window no longer disappears into the background when MeteoSyn is called up.
    - Simulation of time-controlled charging for DC-coupled battery systems was not possible.
    - Error in the system check with Huawei optimizers.
    - New license management:
      - Crash when starting PV*SOL (UUID not available on some computers).
      - Crash if the license file could not be written.
