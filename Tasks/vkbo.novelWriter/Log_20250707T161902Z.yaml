    Release Notes
    This is a patch release that fixes a bug in, and makes a few improvement to, Preferences.
    Detailed Changelog
    Bugfixes
    - Fixes an issue where novelWriter would crash if a % was added to any of the free text settings fields in Preferences. Issue #2455. PR #2456.
    Improvements
    - The "Dialogue line symbols" setting in Preferences now has an "Add" button with a dropdown menu for all the symbols allowed in this field. Since virtually none of them are available on a regular keyboard, this makes it easier to add them and more transparent which symbols are allowed in the box. Issue #2453. PR #2457.
    - The switch for the "Allow open-ended dialogue" setting in Preferences has been moved up one line so it is clearer that it only applies to quoted dialogue, and not to the alternative dialogue settings. Issue #2454. PR #2457.
    Packaging
    - Package license information has been updated to also list the licenses for the new icon themes. Issue #2434. PRs #2435 and #2458.
