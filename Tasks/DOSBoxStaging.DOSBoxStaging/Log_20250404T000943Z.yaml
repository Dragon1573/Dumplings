    The focus of this minor maintenance release is to fix a few regressions introduced in 0.82.0, and to add a few small enhancements.
    Regression fixes
    - Fixed dual-mouse gaming support not working on Windows. This broke the dual-mouse feature in the The Settlers and The Settlers II: Veni, Vidi, Vici on Windows only.
    - A new file_locking setting has been introduced to allow disabling file locking (previously, file locking was always enabled). Setting file_locking = off fixes the regression of the demo Astral Blur by The Black Lotus not starting up. Please refer to the setting's description to learn more (e.g., run config -h file_locking from the DOS prompt).
    - Fixed a regression where configuration settings were handled in a case-sensitive manner across the board (they should be case-insentive; e.g., cpu_cycles, CPU_CYCLES and Cpu_CYCles should refer to the same setting).
    Enhancements and fixes
    - Now you can queue setting changes that are unchangeable at runtime. The queued setting will be applied on the next emulator restart (via the config -r command or the restart hotkey). For example, execute the following commands to change the machine type to CGA and use 1 MB of RAM:
      machine cga
      memsize 1
      config -r
    - Config files written with config -wc PATH and -wcd commands now have a blank line inserted after each setting's description to improve readability.
    - Fixed a bug where certain startup_verbosity settings could lead to a blank console.
