  Key: ReleaseNotes
  Value: |-
    1. When extracting a file, previous versions of WinRAR, Windows versions
         of RAR, UnRAR, portable UnRAR source code and UnRAR.dll can be tricked
         into using a path, defined in a specially crafted archive,
         instead of user specified path.

         Unix versions of RAR, UnRAR, portable UnRAR source code
         and UnRAR library, also as RAR for Android, are not affected.

         We are thankful to whs3-detonator working with Trend Micro Zero Day
         Initiative for letting us know about this security issue.

      2. Previously "Generate report" command included archived file names
         into HTML report as is, allowing to inject potentially unsafe HTML tags
         into the report. To prevent such injection the current version replaces
         < and > file name characters in HTML report with < and > strings.

         We are thankful to Marcin Bobryk (github.com/MarcinB44) for bringing
         this security issue to our attention.

      3. If "Test archived files" and "recovery volumes" archiving options
         are used together, recovery volumes are also tested. Previous versions
         completed the test before creating recovery volumes, so they hadn't
         been verified.

      4. Nanosecond file time precision is preserved for Unix file records
         when modifying RAR archive in Windows. Previously it was converted
         to Windows 100 nanosecond precision.
RealVersion: 7.12.0
