    1. If "Add to archive..." Explorer context menu command is applied to
         multiple archives in the disk root, for example, d:\arc1.rar
         and d:\arc2.rar, WinRAR will propose arc1_rar.rar default name
         for a new archive. Previous version proposed arc1.rar, updating one
         of selected archives instead of creating a new one.

      2. Bugs fixed:

         a) WinRAR 7.10 failed to update solid archives containing a folder
            record placed before a file record. It issued the checksum error
            message and aborted processing.

            As a result of this fix, this version preserves the original position
            of such folders after updating and doesn't move them to the end
            of archive as WinRAR 7.10 did;

         b) when extracting a file from CAB archive over an existing file,
            existing files were overwritten, but not truncated.
            So if existing file was larger than extracted, existing file data
            had been left at the end of the extracted file;

         c) if SFX module from "Advanced SFX options" dialog was stored
            in the compression profile, it was applied as is, even if archive
            format was changed after selecting the profile. It could result
            in SFX module mismatching the archive format;

         d) choosing a value in bytes from drop down list associated
            with archive dialog "Split to volumes, size" field didn't set
            units to bytes automatically;

         e) if SFX "TextDone" command was used together with "Silent"
            and "TempMode" commands, the completion message was sometimes
            displayed behind other opened windows.
