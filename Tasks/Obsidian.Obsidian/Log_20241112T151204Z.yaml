    - Clicking on a link in page preview will no longer switch the preview to edit mode.
    - Fixed regression where Obsidian URI left the target window minimized.
    - Fixed issue with parser using too much memory to parse larger Markdown files. This could cause Obsidian to crash when opening very large Markdown files.
