    No longer broken
    - Updated the behavior of the "Add internal link" command so the cursor is placed at the end of the link text, and the link suggestion pop-up appears.
    - Fixed issues where Sync Sidebar timestamps would not reflect changes made locally.
    - Improved render performance of Canvas when there are many nodes on the screen.
    - Fixed issues where the attachment folder would be displayed incorrectly in settings.
    - Fixed regression where the "Add tag" command was not causing the tag suggestions to appear.
    - Fixed bug where Sandbox vault would fail to load if the "Start here" file was missing.
    - File Explorer: "Reveal in file navigation" now waits for the view to load.
    - Fixed bug where tree components (such as the Outline view) would be slow to refresh on Android.
    - Fixed bug where switching between Obsidian and other apps would cause the navigation bar and the toolbar to both be active.
    - Fixed "Installing theme" notice not disappearing when installing a legacy theme.
    - Fixed middle-click not closing tabs.

    Developers
    - The installer has been updated to use Electron v32 (requires downloading the latest installer).
    - Fixed vim langmap failing to load properly.
