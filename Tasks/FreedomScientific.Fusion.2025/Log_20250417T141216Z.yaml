    The following describes improvements made in the April 2025 update.
    Fixes for Chrome and Edge Compatibility Issues
    Recent updates to Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge impacted how ZoomText reads, tracks, and echoes text within these browsers. This update resolves or improves those issues:
    - AppReader has been improved for reading bulleted lists.
    - Mouse echo now correctly reads bulleted lists as you hover over them.
    - Cursor tracking has been fixed to track the cursor position and show the cursor enhancement as you type and navigate in multiline edit fields.
