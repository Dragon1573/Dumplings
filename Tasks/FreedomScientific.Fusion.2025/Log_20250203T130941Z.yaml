    The following describes improvements made in the December 2024 update.
    FSCompanion: Your AI-Powered assistant for Learning ZoomText, Fusion, and Microsoft Applications
    With so many features and keystrokes available between ZoomText, Fusion, Windows, and the various Office apps, it can be challenging to locate the information you need to perform a specific task or even look up a setting or keystroke you no longer recall. The new AI assistant, FSCompanion, lets you ask questions about ZoomText, Fusion and other applications and quickly provides the information you need without you having to search through multiple documents and web pages to find it. Want to know how a particular feature works, or the sequence of keystrokes to perform a specific task in Word? Ask FSCompanion, and the AI searches through various help and training resources in a matter of seconds, and provides the key details in a concise step-by-step format.
    FSCompanion has been trained using ZoomText help and training data, as well as support content from Microsoft.
    To open FSCompanion, do one of the following:
    - Click the blue Sparkle button in the upper right corner in the Fusion or ZoomText toolbar.

    - In the ZoomText or Fusion menu, choose Help > FSCompanion.

    - You can also access FSCompanion directly in your web browser by going to FSCompanion.ai.
    Once the FSCompanion page opens, focus is placed in an edit field where you can immediately type a question. After typing a question, press ENTER, and ZoomText or Fusion will automatically read the response as soon as it is displayed. Focus remains in the edit field, so you can ask any follow-up questions. Select the New Conversation button to start a new topic, or select the Feedback button to submit any comments about a response.
    Here are a few example questions to help get you started.
    - How do I change magnification?
    - How do I toggle speech on and off for Fusion?
    - How do I turn on AppReader?
    - How do I select color modes?
    Please ask as many questions as you like, and don't hesitate to give feedback on your experiences. The types of questions you ask and the feedback you provide are important as it helps our team train the model to be more accurate.
    Note: FSCompanion is optimized for English, as it has been trained with English documentation. This means that the answers it gives are based on English keystrokes and terminology. For the best experience, please use it in English. If you ask questions in another language, the keystrokes and descriptions it provides might not be accurate. We are working on supporting additional languages.
    Other Enhancements
    - After upgrading to Windows 11 version 24H2, some users found that they no longer had magnification or a mouse pointer after starting ZoomText and Fusion 2025. This update solves the problem.
    - AppReader Text View now opens and works correctly when reading Word 365 documents.
    - In AppReader's App View, the UP and DOWN Arrow keys no longer navigated to the previous and next paragraphs in Word 365 and other apps. This update solves the problem.
    - All text is correctly displayed and spoken in App View and Text View when running AppReader in Edge, Chrome, or Firefox.
    - When using Quicken, a personal financial app, transaction fields and menus now read correctly when using mouse echo with ZoomText 2025.
