    - CSV Export options that were previously only available via command line are now selectable when using the Export to CSV function. Additional data items can be included in the export along with extra filtering and sorting options. Note that either "Tree View" or "File View" data will be exported depending on which tab is active. Select the correct tab before selecting the CSV export function.
    - CSV file exports will now include drive size info by default (total space, space used, space free and reserved space). To exclude this info from the exported CSV file, set command line parameter /exportdrivecapacity=0
    - CSV files containing drive size info will have the info displayed on screen (previously only space used was displayed when importing a CSV file)
    - CSV file import speed greatly increased
    - Fixed bug in 32 bit version that would prevent Windows\System32 folder from being scanned correctly when using slower non NTFS method
