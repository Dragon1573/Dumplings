    Released on: 2025-01-30
    - Fixes a bug where HttpServer responses were not correctly encoded if a "Content-Type" header was set (issue #59719).
    - Fix dart format to parse code at language version 3.6 so that digit separators can be parsed correctly (issue #59815, dart_style issue #1630).
    - Fixes an issue where the DevTools analytics did not distinguish between new and legacy inspector events (issue #59884).
    - When running dart fix on a folder that contains a library with multiple files and more than one needs a fix, the fix will now be applied correctly only once to each file (issue #59572).
